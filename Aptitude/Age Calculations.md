# AGE CALCULATIONS - COMPLETE MASTERY GUIDE FOR GOVERNMENT EXAMS

## 1. FOUNDATION TO ADVANCED COVERAGE

### **BASIC CONCEPTS**

**What are Age Problems?**
Age problems involve relationships between ages of people at different points in time (past, present, or future).

**Key Time Frames:**
- **Present Age** - Current age
- **Past Age** - Age x years ago = Present age - x
- **Future Age** - Age after x years = Present age + x

**Basic Principle:**
The *difference* between two people's ages **REMAINS CONSTANT** throughout their lives.

**Example:** If A is 30 and B is 20 today:
- Difference = 10 years
- 5 years ago: A was 25, B was 15 (difference = 10)
- 5 years later: A will be 35, B will be 25 (difference = 10)

### **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TECHNIQUES**

**Type 1: Ratio-Based Problems**

When ages are given in ratios, multiply by a variable (usually x).

**Example:** Ages of A and B are in ratio 3:4
- A's age = 3x
- B's age = 4x

**Type 2: Sum and Difference Problems**

**Example:** Sum of ages = 50, difference = 10
- Older person = (50 + 10)/2 = 30
- Younger person = (50 - 10)/2 = 20

**Type 3: Fraction/Multiple Problems**

"A's age is 3/4 of B's age" means: A = (3/4)B

### **ADVANCED PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES**

**Type 4: Three or More Persons**

Set up equations using present ages and solve systematically.

**Type 5: Average Age Problems**

Total age = Average age × Number of persons

**Type 6: Father-Son Classical Problems**

Usually involves ratios at different time periods.

**Type 7: Age Replacement Problems**

When someone joins/leaves a group, average changes.

## 2. FORMULAS & SHORTCUTS

### **CORE FORMULAS**

**Formula 1: Age n years ago/hence**
```
Past age = Present age - n
Future age = Present age + n
```

**Formula 2: Sum-Difference Formula**
```
When sum and difference are given:
Larger value = (Sum + Difference)/2
Smaller value = (Sum - Difference)/2
```

**Formula 3: Ratio to Actual Age**
```
If ratio is a:b and sum is S:
First person's age = (a/(a+b)) × S
Second person's age = (b/(a+b)) × S
```

**Formula 4: Age Difference**
```
Difference in ages = Constant (never changes)
```

**Formula 5: Average Age Change**
```
New Average = Old Average + (Age of new person - Age of leaving person)/Total persons
```

### **TIME-SAVING SHORTCUTS**

**Shortcut 1: RATIO CHANGE METHOD**

When ratio changes from a:b to c:d after n years:

**For 2 persons:**
```
n = (b×c - a×d)/(a+b-c-d) × (time gap between ratios)
```

**Faster approach:** Use the cross-multiplication difference method.

**Shortcut 2: PERCENTAGE TO FRACTION**

Instead of calculating percentages, convert to fractions:
- 50% = 1/2
- 25% = 1/4
- 75% = 3/4
- 20% = 1/5

**Shortcut 3: REVERSE CALCULATION**

If "x years ago, age was..." → Work backward from present.

**Shortcut 4: ELIMINATION METHOD**

For MCQs, substitute options to verify - often faster than solving algebraically.

**Shortcut 5: ASSUMPTION TECHNIQUE**

Assume convenient values for ratios (use LCM for denominators).

**Shortcut 6: QUICK RATIO PROBLEMS**

If present ratio is a:b and after n years is c:d:
```
Set up: (ax + n)/(bx + n) = c/d
Solve for x quickly using cross multiplication
```

### **ALTERNATIVE METHODS**

**Method 1: Algebraic (Traditional)**
- Set variables, form equations, solve
- **Best for:** Complex problems with 3+ people

**Method 2: Ratio Method**
- Convert everything to ratios
- **Best for:** Problems with given ratios

**Method 3: Options Testing**
- Substitute given options
- **Best for:** MCQs when calculation seems lengthy

**Method 4: Logical Reasoning**
- Use age difference constant principle
- **Best for:** Simple 2-person problems

### **WHEN TO USE WHICH METHOD**

| Problem Type | Best Method | Time Taken |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Simple ratio (2 people) | Ratio method | 20-30 sec |
| Sum + Difference | Formula direct | 15-20 sec |
| MCQ with options | Option testing | 30-40 sec |
| 3+ people complex | Algebraic | 60-90 sec |
| Average changes | Formula + logic | 30-45 sec |

## 3. MEMORY TECHNIQUES

### **MNEMONICS FOR FORMULAS**

**"PAPA FAFA"** - For time relationships
- **P**resent **A**ge **P**lus = **A**fter (Future)
- **F**ormer **A**ge = **F**rom **A**ge (Subtract)

**"SuD DiV 2"** - For sum-difference problems
- **Su**m plus **D**ifference **Div**ided by **2** = Larger
- **Su**m minus **D**ifference **Div**ided by **2** = Smaller

**"RAT-SUM"** - For ratio problems
- **R**atio × **A**ny = **T**otal
- **S**pecific part = (Ratio of that part/**U**nit sum) × **M**ain sum

**"DAC"** - The golden rule
- **D**ifference in **A**ges is **C**onstant

### **VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES**

**Timeline Method:**
```
Past ←------ Present ------→ Future
(Age - n)      Age      (Age + n)

        Difference remains SAME across timeline
```

**Ratio Bar Method:**
Visualize ratios as bars:
```
Person A: [===] (ratio 3)
Person B: [====] (ratio 4)
Each block = x years
```

### **PATTERN RECOGNITION TIPS**

**Pattern 1:** If "n years ago ratio was p:q" and "after m years ratio will be r:s"
→ The time gap is (n + m) years between the two scenarios

**Pattern 2:** If ages are in ratio and sum is given
→ Total parts × value of one part = sum

**Pattern 3:** Father-son problems often have ratio patterns:
- Common ratios: 2:1, 3:1, 5:2, 7:3
- After certain years, ratio becomes 2:1 or 3:2

**Pattern 4:** Average age increase/decrease
→ Always equals (incoming age - outgoing age)/number of people

### **LIFELONG MEMORY HOOKS**

🎯 **"Birthday Rule":** Everyone's birthday adds 1 year simultaneously - difference stays same!

🎯 **"Age Gap Never Closes":** No matter how fast the younger grows, the gap remains constant.

🎯 **"The Ratio Shift":** Ratios change with time, but the actual difference doesn't.

🎯 **"Future = Present + Time, Past = Present - Time":** Simple addition/subtraction rule.

## 4. GOVERNMENT EXAM QUESTIONS (15-20 Previous Year Questions)

### **BASIC LEVEL (Questions 1-5)**

---

**Q1. [SSC CGL 2019] The ratio of present ages of A and B is 3:4. Five years ago, the ratio of their ages was 2:3. Find the present age of A.**

**Method 1: Ratio Method (FASTEST - 25 seconds)**
```
Present: A = 3x, B = 4x
5 years ago: A = 3x-5, B = 4x-5

Given: (3x-5)/(4x-5) = 2/3

Cross multiply:
3(3x-5) = 2(4x-5)
9x - 15 = 8x - 10
x = 5

A's present age = 3x = 15 years
```

**Method 2: Option Testing (30 seconds)**
Options: (a) 12 (b) 15 (c) 18 (d) 20

Test (b) 15: If A = 15, then B = 20 (ratio 3:4)
5 years ago: A = 10, B = 15 → Ratio = 10:15 = 2:3 ✓

**Answer: 15 years**

**Exam Tip:** Use Method 1 for accuracy, Method 2 for speed in MCQs.

**Method: SuD DiV 2 Formula (15 seconds)**
```
Elder = (Sum + Difference)/2
     = (60 + 10)/2
     = 70/2
     = 35 years
```

**Verification:**
Younger = (60 - 10)/2 = 25 years
Sum = 35 + 25 = 60 ✓
Difference = 35 - 25 = 10 ✓

**Answer: 35 years**

**Exam Tip:** This formula saves 40 seconds compared to forming equations.

---

**Q3. [IBPS PO 2021] Ten years ago, A's age was half of B's age. If the ratio of their present ages is 3:4, what is the sum of their present ages?**

**Method: Reverse Working (30 seconds)**
```
Present ratio: A:B = 3:4
Let A = 3x, B = 4x

10 years ago: A = 3x-10, B = 4x-10

Given: 3x-10 = (1/2)(4x-10)
6x - 20 = 4x - 10
2x = 10
x = 5

A = 15, B = 20
Sum = 35 years
```

**Answer: 35 years**

---

**Q4. [SSC CHSL 2020] A father is three times as old as his son. After 15 years, he will be twice as old as his son. Find the present age of the son.**

**Method: Standard Equation (35 seconds)**
```
Let son's age = x
Father's age = 3x

After 15 years:
Son = x + 15
Father = 3x + 15

Given: 3x + 15 = 2(x + 15)
3x + 15 = 2x + 30
x = 15 years
```

**Option Testing Method (25 seconds):**
Test option 15: Father = 45
After 15 years: Son = 30, Father = 60
60 = 2 × 30 ✓

**Answer: 15 years**

---

**Q5. [RRB Group D 2022] The average age of 5 students is 20 years. If one student of age 25 years leaves and a new student joins, the average becomes 19 years. Find the age of the new student.**

**Method: Average Formula (20 seconds)**
```
Total age of 5 students = 5 × 20 = 100 years
Student leaves: 25 years
Remaining total = 100 - 25 = 75 years

New total for 5 students = 5 × 19 = 95 years
New student's age = 95 - 75 = 20 years
```

**Shortcut:**
```
Change in average = -1 year for 5 people
Total decrease = 5 × 1 = 5 years
Person leaving = 25 years
New person = 25 - 5 = 20 years
```

**Answer: 20 years**

---

### **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Questions 6-12)**

---

**Q6. [SSC CGL 2018] The ages of A, B, and C are in the ratio 2:3:4. Six years ago, the sum of their ages was 54 years. Find the present age of B.**

**Method: Ratio Sum Method (40 seconds)**
```
Present ages: A = 2x, B = 3x, C = 4x
6 years ago: A = 2x-6, B = 3x-6, C = 4x-6

Sum 6 years ago = 54
(2x-6) + (3x-6) + (4x-6) = 54
9x - 18 = 54
9x = 72
x = 8

B's present age = 3x = 24 years
```

**Quick Check:**
Present sum = 16 + 24 + 32 = 72
6 years ago sum = 10 + 18 + 26 = 54 ✓

**Answer: 24 years**

---

**Q7. [IBPS Clerk 2019] A man's age is 4 times his son's age. In 20 years, his age will be twice his son's age. What is the present age of the man?**

**Method: Direct Equation (35 seconds)**
```
Let son = x, man = 4x

After 20 years:
Son = x + 20, Man = 4x + 20

Given: 4x + 20 = 2(x + 20)
4x + 20 = 2x + 40
2x = 20
x = 10

Man's age = 4x = 40 years
```

**Answer: 40 years**

---

**Q8. [Railway Group D 2019] Six years hence, the ratio of ages of A and B will be 5:3. Four years ago, the ratio was 3:1. Find A's present age.**

**Method: Two Time Points (50 seconds)**
```
Let present ages: A = a, B = b

6 years hence: (a+6)/(b+6) = 5/3
→ 3(a+6) = 5(b+6)
→ 3a + 18 = 5b + 30
→ 3a - 5b = 12 ... (1)

4 years ago: (a-4)/(b-4) = 3/1
→ a - 4 = 3(b - 4)
→ a - 4 = 3b - 12
→ a - 3b = -8 ... (2)

From (2): a = 3b - 8
Substitute in (1):
3(3b-8) - 5b = 12
9b - 24 - 5b = 12
4b = 36
b = 9

a = 3(9) - 8 = 19 years
```

**Answer: 19 years**

---

**Q9. [SSC CGL 2020] A person's present age is 2/5 of his mother's present age. After 8 years, he will be 1/2 of his mother's age. What is the mother's present age?**

**Method: Fraction Equation (45 seconds)**
```
Let mother's age = M
Person's age = (2/5)M

After 8 years:
Person = (2/5)M + 8
Mother = M + 8

Given: (2/5)M + 8 = (1/2)(M + 8)
Multiply by 10:
4M + 80 = 5M + 40
M = 40 years
```

**Answer: 40 years**

---

**Q10. [IBPS RRB 2021] The ratio of the present ages of A and B is 7:5. Five years from now, the ratio will be 4:3. Find the present age of A.**

**Method: Ratio Change (40 seconds)**
```
Present: A = 7x, B = 5x
After 5 years: A = 7x+5, B = 5x+5

Given: (7x+5)/(5x+5) = 4/3
21x + 15 = 20x + 20
x = 5

A's present age = 7x = 35 years
```

**Answer: 35 years**

---

**Q11. [SSC CHSL 2019] A is 3 years older than B. Six years ago, A's age was four times B's age. What are their present ages?**

**Method: Difference Constant (45 seconds)**
```
Difference = 3 years (constant)
Let B's present age = b
A's present age = b + 3

6 years ago:
A = b + 3 - 6 = b - 3
B = b - 6

Given: b - 3 = 4(b - 6)
b - 3 = 4b - 24
21 = 3b
b = 7

B = 7 years, A = 10 years
```

**Answer: A = 10 years, B = 7 years**

---

**Q12. [RRB NTPC 2021] The average age of a family of 5 members is 24 years. If the age of the youngest member is 8 years, what was the average age of the family at the birth of the youngest member?**

**Method: Reverse Calculation (35 seconds)**
```
Present total age = 5 × 24 = 120 years

At birth of youngest (8 years ago):
- Youngest's age = 0
- Other 4 members were 8 years younger each
- Total reduction = 4 × 8 + 8 = 40 years

Total age then = 120 - 40 = 80 years
Members then = 4 (youngest not born)

Average = 80/4 = 20 years
```

**Answer: 20 years**

---

### **ADVANCED LEVEL (Questions 13-20)**

---

**Q13. [SSC CGL 2017] The sum of the ages of a father and son is 45 years. Five years ago, the product of their ages was 124. What are their present ages?**

**Method: Quadratic Equation (60 seconds)**
```
Let father = f, son = s
f + s = 45 ... (1)

5 years ago: (f-5)(s-5) = 124
fs - 5f - 5s + 25 = 124
fs - 5(f+s) = 99
fs - 5(45) = 99
fs = 324 ... (2)

From (1): f = 45 - s
Substitute in (2):
(45-s)s = 324
45s - s² = 324
s² - 45s + 324 = 0
(s - 36)(s - 9) = 0
s = 9 or 36

If s = 9, f = 36 (logical)
If s = 36, f = 9 (father younger than son - reject)
```

**Answer: Father = 36 years, Son = 9 years**

---

**Q14. [IBPS PO 2020] A's age is 1/6 of B's age. B's age will be twice C's age after 10 years. If C's eighth birthday was celebrated 2 years ago, what is A's present age?**

**Method: Step-by-Step Logic (50 seconds)**
```
C's 8th birthday was 2 years ago
→ C's present age = 10 years

After 10 years: C = 20 years
B will be twice C's age = 2 × 20 = 40 years

B's present age = 40 - 10 = 30 years

A's age = (1/6) × B = 30/6 = 5 years
```

**Answer: 5 years**

---

**Q15. [Railway NTPC 2019] Ten years from now, A will be twice as old as B. Ten years ago, A was four times as old as B. What is the present age of A?**

**Method: Two Equations (55 seconds)**
```
Let present ages: A = a, B = b

10 years hence: a + 10 = 2(b + 10)
→ a + 10 = 2b + 20
→ a = 2b + 10 ... (1)

10 years ago: a - 10 = 4(b - 10)
→ a - 10 = 4b - 40
→ a = 4b - 30 ... (2)

Equate (1) and (2):
2b + 10 = 4b - 30
40 = 2b
b = 20

a = 2(20) + 10 = 50 years
```

**Answer: 50 years**

---

**Q16. [SSC CGL 2021] The ages of A and B are in the ratio 3:5. After 9 years, the ratio will be 3:4. What is the difference in their ages?**

**Method: Difference Shortcut (30 seconds)**
```
Present: A = 3x, B = 5x
Difference = 5x - 3x = 2x

After 9 years: (3x+9)/(5x+9) = 3/4
12x + 36 = 15x + 27
9 = 3x
x = 3

Difference = 2x = 6 years
```

**Shortcut Logic:** Difference in ages = constant = 2x (no need to find actual ages!)

**Answer: 6 years**

---

**Q17. [IBPS Clerk 2018] A man is 24 years older than his son. In two years, his age will be twice his son's age. What is the present age of the son?**

**Method: Direct Substitution (25 seconds)**
```
Let son = s, man = s + 24

After 2 years: s + 24 + 2 = 2(s + 2)
s + 26 = 2s + 4
22 = s
```

**Answer: 22 years**

---

**Q18. [SSC CHSL 2021] The average age of a cricket team of 11 players is 25 years. If the captain's age is included, the average increases by 1 year. What is the captain's age if he is not one of the initial 11 players?**

**Trick Question Alert!** Read carefully - captain is ADDITIONAL (12th person)

**Method: Average Change (30 seconds)**
```
Total age of 11 players = 11 × 25 = 275 years

With captain (12 people): Average = 26 years
Total = 12 × 26 = 312 years

Captain's age = 312 - 275 = 37 years
```

**Answer: 37 years**

---

**Q19. [RRB Group D 2021] A's age 4 years ago was 3 times B's age at that time. A's age 4 years hence will be 2 times B's age at that time. What is the ratio of their present ages?**

**Method: Standard Equation (50 seconds)**
```
Let present ages: A = a, B = b

4 years ago: a - 4 = 3(b - 4)
→ a - 4 = 3b - 12
→ a = 3b - 8 ... (1)

4 years hence: a + 4 = 2(b + 4)
→ a + 4 = 2b + 8
→ a = 2b + 4 ... (2)

Equate (1) and (2):
3b - 8 = 2b + 4
b = 12

a = 2(12) + 4 = 28

Ratio = 28:12 = 7:3
```

**Answer: 7:3**

---

**Q20. [SSC CGL 2022 - DIFFICULT] The sum of the present ages of a husband and wife is 100 years. Five years ago, the ratio of their ages was 5:4. What will be the ratio of their ages 5 years hence?**

**Method: Multi-Step (60 seconds)**
```
Present: H + W = 100 ... (1)

5 years ago: (H-5)/(W-5) = 5/4
→ 4(H-5) = 5(W-5)
→ 4H - 20 = 5W - 25
→ 4H - 5W = -5 ... (2)

From (1): H = 100 - W
Substitute in (2):
4(100-W) - 5W = -5
400 - 4W - 5W = -5
405 = 9W
W = 45

H = 55

5 years hence:
H = 60, W = 50
Ratio = 60:50 = 6:5
```

**Answer: 6:5**

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES & TRAPS

### **FREQUENT ERRORS**

❌ **Mistake 1: Confusing "ago" with "hence"**
- **Wrong:** "5 years ago" → Adding 5 to present age
- **Right:** "5 years ago" → Subtracting 5 from present age

🎯 **How to Avoid:** Remember **PAPA FAFA** mnemonic

---

❌ **Mistake 2: Not maintaining age difference constant**
- **Example:** If difference is 10 now, assuming it changes in future
- **Truth:** Difference ALWAYS remains the same

🎯 **How to Avoid:** Before solving, note the difference and verify at the end

---

❌ **Mistake 3: Wrong ratio simplification**
- **Wrong:** 15:20 = 3:5 (incorrect division)
- **Right:** 15:20 = 3:4 (divide by 5)

🎯 **How to Avoid:** Always find HCF correctly

---

❌ **Mistake 4: Calculation errors in cross multiplication**
- **Example:** (3x-5)/(4x-5) = 2/3
- **Wrong:** 3(3x-5) = 4(2x-5) [multiplying denominators wrongly]
- **Right:** 3(3x-5) = 2(4x-5) [cross multiply correctly]

🎯 **How to Avoid:** Write "cross multiply" and draw actual cross lines

---

❌ **Mistake 5: Forgetting to answer what's asked**
- Question asks: "Age of father"
- You calculate: Son's age and stop
- **Always read the last line of the question again before answering**

---

❌ **Mistake 6: Sign errors in equations**
- **Example:** a - 3b = -8
- **Wrong:** a = -8 + 3b (forgetting to change sign)
- **Right:** a = 3b - 8

🎯 **How to Avoid:** Move terms carefully, changing signs

---

❌ **Mistake 7: Average calculation errors**
- **Wrong:** Change in average = New person's age - Old person's age
- **Right:** Change in TOTAL average = (Change per person) / Number of persons

---

### **TRICK QUESTIONS COMMONLY ASKED**

🎪 **Trap 1: Extra Person in Average Problems**

**Question:** "Average age of 11 players is 25. When captain joins, average becomes 26. Find captain's age."

**Trap:** Students think captain is already included in 11
**Reality:** Captain is 12th person
**Solution:** Total of 11 = 275, Total of 12 = 312, Captain = 37

---

🎪 **Trap 2: Logical vs Mathematical Answer**

**Question:** "Father is 3 times son's age. After 15 years, he'll be twice. Find son's age."

**Options:** (a) 5 years (b) 15 years (c) 20 years (d) 25 years

**Trap:** (a) seems too young, students avoid it
**Reality:** Answer IS 5 years (mathematically correct, even if son seems young)

---

🎪 **Trap 3: Negative Age Scenarios**

**Question:** "10 years ago, ratio was 5:3. Now it's 7:5. Find ages."

**Trap:** Solution gives negative age for past
**Reality:** Question is faulty OR you made calculation error - recheck

---

🎪 **Trap 4: Two Valid Solutions**

**Example:** Product of ages = 36, sum = 13
Possible: (9, 4) or (12, 3) - but (12, 3) has sum = 15

**Trap:** Picking first solution without checking both conditions
**Solution:** ALWAYS verify all given conditions

---

🎪 **Trap 5: Ratio Confusion**

**Question:** "A's age is to B's age as 3:4"

**Trap 1:** Thinking A is older (3 < 4, so A is younger!)
**Trap 2:** Writing A = 3, B = 4 (should be 3x and 4x)

---

🎪 **Trap 6: "Sum of Ages" Ambiguity**

**Question:** "Sum of ages of A, B, C is 60. A is twice B."

**Trap:** Assuming A + B = 60 (forgetting C)
**Reality:** A + B + C = 60

---

### **AVOIDING CALCULATION MISTAKES**

✅ **Strategy 1: Verify with Options**
After solving, quickly check if your answer matches an option

✅ **Strategy 2: Use Estimation**
If calculating 127/3, know answer should be around 42, not 142

✅ **Strategy 3: Cross-Check with Another Method**
If time permits, verify using different approach

✅ **Strategy 4: Maintain Clean Working**
Don't overwrite - messy work leads to errors

✅ **Strategy 5: Underline What's Asked**
Before starting, underline "Find A's age" to avoid answering B's age

✅ **Strategy 6: Quick Reasonability Check**
If father comes 15 years, son 45 years → WRONG, recheck!

### **TIPS FOR SPEED AND ACCURACY**

**⚡ SPEED BOOSTERS**

**1. Recognize Pattern Instantly (5 seconds saved)**
- Ratio given → Use ratio method
- Sum + Difference → Use formula directly
- Average change → Calculate using shortcut

**2. Skip Complex Algebra for MCQs (20 seconds saved)**
- Test middle option first (usually correct answer)
- Eliminate obviously wrong options

**3. Mental Math Practice**
- Multiply by 5: Multiply by 10, divide by 2
- Divide by 4: Divide by 2 twice
- Percentages: Know fraction equivalents

**4. Use Scratch Smartly**
- Don't write full equations
- Use symbols: P (present), F (future), Pa (past)
- Abbreviate names: A, B, C instead of Amit, Bhavan, Chetan

**5. Shortcut Fractions**
| Fraction | Percentage | Mental Trick |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| 1/2 | 50% | Half |
| 1/4 | 25% | Quarter |
| 3/4 | 75% | Three quarters |
| 1/5 | 20% | Divide by 5 |
| 2/5 | 40% | Double of 1/5 |

**🎯 ACCURACY BOOSTERS**

**1. Read Question Twice**
- First time: Understand scenario
- Second time: Identify what to find

**2. Note Down Given Information**
```
Example format:
Given: A:B = 3:4 (present)
       After 5 years: A:B = 5:6
Find: A's present age
```

**3. Verify Answer Makes Sense**
- Ages should be positive
- Older person should have higher age
- Difference should match in past/present/future

**4. Double-Check Arithmetic**
- Cross multiply carefully
- Sign changes when moving terms
- Division/multiplication order

**5. Practice Common Tricky Scenarios**
- Negative results → Wrong approach
- Too large ages (>100) → Check calculation
- Fractional ages → Verify if question allows
