# Complete Algebra Mastery Guide for Government Exams

## PART 1: FOUNDATION TO ADVANCED COVERAGE

### **LEVEL 1: BASIC CONCEPTS (Foundation)**

#### What is Algebra?
Algebra is the branch of mathematics where we use letters (variables) to represent unknown numbers. Think of it as "mathematical detective work" where you find the missing value.

**Real-world example:** If mangoes cost ₹x each and you buy 5 mangoes for ₹100, then 5x = 100, so x = 20.

#### Core Definitions:

1. **Variable**: A letter representing an unknown number (x, y, z)
2. **Constant**: A fixed number (5, -3, 100)
3. **Coefficient**: The number multiplying a variable (in 5x, coefficient is 5)
4. **Expression**: Combination of variables and constants (3x + 5)
5. **Equation**: Expression with an equals sign (3x + 5 = 20)
6. **Linear Equation**: Highest power of variable is 1 (2x + 3 = 7)
7. **Quadratic Equation**: Highest power is 2 (x² + 5x + 6 = 0)

#### Basic Operations:

**Addition/Subtraction of like terms:**
- 3x + 5x = 8x ✓
- 3x + 5y = 3x + 5y (cannot add unlike terms) ✓

**Multiplication:**
- x × x = x²
- 3x × 4y = 12xy
- (x + 2)(x + 3) = x² + 5x + 6

### **LEVEL 2: INTERMEDIATE TECHNIQUES**

#### 1. Linear Equations (One Variable)

**Standard Form:** ax + b = 0

**Solution Method:**
- Step 1: Bring all variable terms to one side
- Step 2: Bring all constants to other side
- Step 3: Divide both sides by coefficient of variable

**Example:** 3x + 7 = 22
- 3x = 22 - 7
- 3x = 15
- x = 5

#### 2. Simultaneous Linear Equations (Two Variables)

**Three Methods:**

**Method 1 - Elimination:**
```
2x + 3y = 13 ... (i)
3x + 2y = 12 ... (ii)

Multiply (i) by 3: 6x + 9y = 39
Multiply (ii) by 2: 6x + 4y = 24
Subtract: 5y = 15, so y = 3

Substitute in (i): 2x + 9 = 13, so x = 2
```

**Method 2 - Substitution:**
```
x + 2y = 8 ... (i)
3x - y = 5 ... (ii)

From (i): x = 8 - 2y
Substitute in (ii): 3(8 - 2y) - y = 5
24 - 6y - y = 5
7y = 19, so y = 19/7
```

**Method 3 - Cross Multiplication (FASTEST for exams):**
For equations: a₁x + b₁y + c₁ = 0 and a₂x + b₂y + c₂ = 0

```
x/(b₁c₂ - b₂c₁) = y/(c₁a₂ - c₂a₁) = 1/(a₁b₂ - a₂b₁)
```

#### 3. Quadratic Equations

**Standard Form:** ax² + bx + c = 0

**Four Solution Methods:**

**Method 1 - Factorization (Fastest when possible):**
```
x² + 5x + 6 = 0
(x + 2)(x + 3) = 0
x = -2 or x = -3
```

**Method 2 - Quadratic Formula (Always works):**
```
x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a

For x² + 5x + 6 = 0:
x = [-5 ± √(25 - 24)] / 2
x = [-5 ± 1] / 2
x = -2 or -3
```

**Method 3 - Completing the Square**

**Method 4 - Sum and Product Method (EXAM SHORTCUT):**
For x² + px + q = 0, if roots are α and β:
- α + β = -p
- α × β = q

Find two numbers that add to -p and multiply to q.

### **LEVEL 3: ADVANCED PROBLEM-SOLVING**

#### 1. Nature of Roots (Discriminant)

For ax² + bx + c = 0, Discriminant D = b² - 4ac

- **D > 0**: Two distinct real roots
- **D = 0**: Two equal real roots (repeated root)
- **D < 0**: No real roots (complex roots)
- **D is perfect square**: Roots are rational
- **D is not perfect square**: Roots are irrational

#### 2. Relationship Between Roots and Coefficients

For ax² + bx + c = 0 with roots α and β:
- **Sum of roots**: α + β = -b/a
- **Product of roots**: α × β = c/a

**Advanced Applications:**
- α² + β² = (α + β)² - 2αβ
- α³ + β³ = (α + β)³ - 3αβ(α + β)
- 1/α + 1/β = (α + β)/αβ
- |α - β| = √[(α + β)² - 4αβ]

#### 3. Forming Equations from Roots

If α and β are roots, equation is:
**x² - (α + β)x + αβ = 0**

**Example:** Form equation with roots 3 and 5:
x² - 8x + 15 = 0

#### 4. Special Types of Equations

**Reciprocal Equations:**
If 1/α is a root when α is a root.

**Equations Reducible to Quadratic:**
- x⁴ - 5x² + 4 = 0 → Let y = x², solve y² - 5y + 4 = 0

## PART 2: ALL FORMULAS & SHORTCUTS

### **CATEGORY 1: ALGEBRAIC IDENTITIES (Must Memorize)**

#### Basic Identities:

1. **(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²**
2. **(a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²**
3. **a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)**
4. **(a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³ = a³ + b³ + 3ab(a + b)**
5. **(a - b)³ = a³ - 3a²b + 3ab² - b³ = a³ - b³ - 3ab(a - b)**
6. **a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²) = (a + b)³ - 3ab(a + b)**
7. **a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²) = (a - b)³ + 3ab(a - b)**
8. **(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca**
9. **a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ca)**

**Special Case:** If a + b + c = 0, then a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc

#### Advanced Identities:

10. **(a + b)⁴ = a⁴ + 4a³b + 6a²b² + 4ab³ + b⁴**
11. **(a - b)⁴ = a⁴ - 4a³b + 6a²b² - 4ab³ + b⁴**
12. **a⁴ + a²b² + b⁴ = (a² + ab + b²)(a² - ab + b²)**
13. **a⁴ - b⁴ = (a - b)(a + b)(a² + b²)**

### **CATEGORY 2: SHORTCUTS FOR COMPETITIVE EXAMS**

#### Shortcut 1: Finding (a + b) and ab when given a² + b²

If a² + b² = x and ab = y, then:
- **(a + b)² = x + 2y**
- **(a - b)² = x - 2y**

#### Shortcut 2: Quick Factorization

For x² + px + q:
Find two numbers that **add to p** and **multiply to q**.

**Example:** x² + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4)
Because 3 + 4 = 7 and 3 × 4 = 12

#### Shortcut 3: Middle Term Split (Under 10 seconds)

For ax² + bx + c, find two numbers that:
- **Add to b**
- **Multiply to a × c**

**Example:** 6x² + 11x + 3
- a × c = 6 × 3 = 18
- Find numbers adding to 11 and multiplying to 18: **9 and 2**
- 6x² + 9x + 2x + 3 = 3x(2x + 3) + 1(2x + 3) = (3x + 1)(2x + 3)

#### Shortcut 4: Quadratic Formula Quick Check

For x² + px + q = 0:
- **Discriminant = p² - 4q**
- If p² = 4q, roots are equal
- If p and q have same sign and |p| > 2√q, both roots are real

#### Shortcut 5: Sum/Product Root Relations (10-Second Method)

Given equation x² - 7x + 12 = 0:
- Sum of roots = 7
- Product = 12
- Numbers: 3 and 4 (since 3 + 4 = 7, 3 × 4 = 12)
- Roots are 3 and 4 ✓

#### Shortcut 6: Finding a² + b² without finding a and b

If a + b = p and ab = q:
**a² + b² = p² - 2q**

**Example:** If a + b = 5 and ab = 6, then a² + b² = 25 - 12 = 13

#### Shortcut 7: Value Substitution Trick

For finding value of expressions, substitute convenient values.

**Example:** If x = 99, find x² + 2x + 1
Think: (x + 1)² = (100)² = 10,000

#### Shortcut 8: Remainder Theorem Quick Use

When polynomial P(x) is divided by (x - a), remainder = P(a)

**Example:** Find remainder when x³ + 3x² + 3x + 1 divided by (x - 1)
Put x = 1: 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8

#### Shortcut 9: Symmetric Expression Shortcut

If a + b = S and ab = P:
- a² + b² = S² - 2P
- a³ + b³ = S³ - 3PS
- a⁴ + b⁴ = S⁴ - 4PS² + 2P²

## PART 3: MEMORY TECHNIQUES

### **MNEMONIC 1: For (a + b)² and (a - b)²**

**"SQUARE PLUS TWICE SQUARE"**
- **(a + b)² = SQUARE + TWICE + SQUARE**
- **a² + 2ab + b²**

**"SQUARE MINUS TWICE SQUARE"**
- **(a - b)² = SQUARE - TWICE + SQUARE**
- **a² - 2ab + b²**

### **MNEMONIC 2: For a³ + b³ and a³ - b³**

**"Sum: Same Sign, Minus Products"**
- **a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)**
- First bracket: same sign as middle
- Second bracket: square, minus product, square

**"Difference: Opposite Sign, Plus Products"**
- **a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)**
- First bracket: opposite sign
- Second bracket: square, plus product, square

### **MNEMONIC 3: For Quadratic Formula**

**"Negative Boy Couldn't Decide Between Going To A Rave Or Staying At Home"**

**x = -b ± √(b² - 4ac) / 2a**
- **Negative B** (-b)
- **Couldn't Decide** (±)
- **Between** (√)
- **Going To A Rave** (b² - 4ac)
- **Or** (/)
- **Staying At Home** (2a)

### **MNEMONIC 4: For Discriminant Cases**

**"Positive = Two Different, Zero = Two Equal, Negative = No Real"**

- **D > 0**: Positive mood = 2 different friends
- **D = 0**: Zero difference = 2 equal twins
- **D < 0**: Negative = no real friends (imaginary)

### **VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUE 1: Identity Patterns**

Picture (a + b)² as a square with sides (a + b):

```
    a       b
  +---+-------+
a | a²|  ab   |
  +---+-------+
b | ab|  b²   |
  +---+-------+

Total = a² + ab + ab + b² = a² + 2ab + b²
```

### **VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUE 2: Difference of Squares**

Think of a² - b² as a large square minus a small square:

**a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)**

Visual: The leftover area when you cut a small square from a large square can be rearranged into a rectangle.

### **PATTERN RECOGNITION TIPS**

#### Pattern 1: Sum of Cubes Sign Pattern
- **a³ + b³**: Signs are **+ - +** in (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)
- **a³ - b³**: Signs are **- + +** in (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)

#### Pattern 2: Power Patterns
- **Even powers**: Always positive (x² ≥ 0, x⁴ ≥ 0)
- **Odd powers**: Can be negative (x³ can be negative)

#### Pattern 3: Coefficient Symmetry
In (a + b)⁴ = a⁴ + 4a³b + 6a²b² + 4ab³ + b⁴
Coefficients: **1, 4, 6, 4, 1** (symmetric - Pascal's Triangle)

### **MEMORY HOOKS THAT LAST**

#### Hook 1: "The Three Brothers"
Three ways to remember (a + b)³:
1. **Long way**: a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³
2. **Factor way**: (a + b)(a² + 2ab + b²)
3. **Identity way**: a³ + b³ + 3ab(a + b)

#### Hook 2: "The Zero Magic"
If **a + b + c = 0**, then **a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc**
Story: Three numbers that cancel out produce triple their product in cubes.

#### Hook 3: "The Root Twins"
For any quadratic:
- Roots **add** to give **-b/a** (opposite of middle term coefficient)
- Roots **multiply** to give **c/a** (constant term ratio)

Think: "ADD opposite, MULTIPLY constant"

## PART 5: COMMON MISTAKES & TRAPS

### **MISTAKE 1: Sign Errors in Identities**

❌ **Wrong:** (a - b)² = a² - b²
✓ **Correct:** (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²

**Memory Hook:** The middle term never disappears in squaring!

**Trap Question:** If a - b = 5 and a² - b² = 35, find a + b.
```
Wrong approach: Thinking a² - b² = (a - b)² = 25
Correct: a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)
35 = (a + b)(5)
a + b = 7
```

---

### **MISTAKE 2: Confusing a² + b² with (a + b)²**

❌ **Common Error:** Thinking (a + b)² = a² + b²
✓ **Correct:** (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²

**Exam Trap:** If a + b = 10, find a² + b².
Students often write 100, but you NEED the value of ab!

If ab is not given, the question cannot be solved.

---

### **MISTAKE 3: Forgetting Both Roots**

❌ **Wrong:** x² = 25, so x = 5
✓ **Correct:** x = ±5

**Exam Impact:** Questions often ask "how many values of x satisfy..." - missing the negative root costs marks!

---

### **MISTAKE 4: Incorrect Factorization**

❌ **Wrong:** x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 4)
✓ **Correct:** x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)

**Quick Check:** Always multiply back to verify!
(x + 2)(x + 3) = x² + 3x + 2x + 6 = x² + 5x + 6 ✓

---

### **MISTAKE 5: Mixing Up Sum and Product of Roots**

For ax² + bx + c = 0:
- Sum = -b/a (NOT b/a)
- Product = c/a

**Trap:** For x² - 7x + 12 = 0, sum of roots is 7 (NOT -7)
Because -(-7)/1 = 7

---

### **MISTAKE 6: Calculation Errors in Quadratic Formula**

Common errors:
- Forgetting the ± sign
- Wrong sign in -b
- Forgetting to multiply 4ac
- Not simplifying the square root

**Safety Check:** After finding roots, substitute back into original equation!

---

### **MISTAKE 7: Assuming Positive Values Only**

**Trap Question:** If x² = 16 and y² = 9, find x + y.

❌ **Wrong:** x = 4, y = 3, so x + y = 7
✓ **Correct:** Multiple possibilities:
- x = 4, y = 3: x + y = 7
- x = 4, y = -3: x + y = 1
- x = -4, y = 3: x + y = -1
- x = -4, y = -3: x + y = -7

**Answer depends on additional constraints!**

---

### **MISTAKE 8: Dividing by Variables Without Checking Zero**

❌ **Dangerous:** From x² = x, dividing by x gives x = 1
✓ **Correct:** x² - x = 0, so x(x - 1) = 0, giving x = 0 or x = 1

**Rule:** NEVER divide by a variable - it might be zero!

### **MISTAKE 9: BODMAS/Order of Operations**

**Trap:** Evaluate: 3x + 2 = 11, find x
❌ **Wrong:** 3x = 11 + 2 = 13, x = 13/3
✓ **Correct:** 3x = 11 - 2 = 9, x = 3

**Remember:** Opposite operation when moving across equals sign!

---

### **MISTAKE 10: Identity Application Errors**

**Trap:** Simplify (x + 2)(x + 3)
❌ **Wrong:** Using (a + b)² formula = x² + 5² = x² + 25
✓ **Correct:** This is NOT an identity case!
(x + 2)(x + 3) = x² + 5x + 6

**Rule:** Identities work ONLY when the form matches exactly!

---

### **TRICK QUESTIONS COMMONLY ASKED**

#### Trick 1: The "Zero Product" Trap
**Q:** If xy = 0 and x + y = 5, find x and y.

**Trap:** Students think both x and y are zero.
**Solution:** If xy = 0, either x = 0 or y = 0 (not both necessarily)
- If x = 0, then y = 5
- If y = 0, then x = 5

---

#### Trick 2: The "Perfect Square" Illusion
**Q:** Factorize x² + 4

**Trap:** Students write (x + 2)²
**Truth:** x² + 4 cannot be factorized using real numbers!
(x + 2)² = x² + 4x + 4 ≠ x² + 4

---

#### Trick 3: The "Discriminant" Deception
**Q:** How many real roots does x² + 2x + 5 = 0 have?

**Quick Check:**
D = 4 - 20 = -16 < 0
**Answer:** No real roots (Zero real roots)

**Trap:** Students assume every quadratic has two roots!

---

#### Trick 4: The "Equation vs Expression" Confusion
**Q:** Simplify 2x + 3x

**Trap:** Students write "= 5x = 0" and solve
**Correct:** 2x + 3x = 5x (STOP - it's an expression, not an equation!)

---

#### Trick 5: The "Coefficient" Trick
**Q:** For 3x² - 7x + 2 = 0, find sum of roots.

**Trap:** Students write -7
**Correct:** Sum = -(-7)/3 = 7/3

**Remember:** Sum = -b/a (don't forget the coefficient of x²!)

### **TIPS FOR SPEED**

#### Speed Tip 1: Skip the Working for Simple Problems
For x + 5 = 12, directly write x = 7 (don't show x = 12 - 5)

#### Speed Tip 2: Mental Math for Perfect Squares
Memorize squares up to 30:
- 11² = 121, 12² = 144, 13² = 169, 14² = 196, 15² = 225
- 16² = 256, 17² = 289, 18² = 324, 19² = 361, 20² = 400
- 25² = 625, 30² = 900

#### Speed Tip 3: Use Options (Multiple Choice)
If asked "solve x² - 7x + 12 = 0":
- Check options by substitution (usually faster than solving)
- If x = 3 is an option, check: 9 - 21 + 12 = 0 ✓

#### Speed Tip 4: Approximate for Checking
If your answer is 3.14159..., and options are 3, 3.5, π, 4
Choose π without exact calculation!

#### Speed Tip 5: Pattern Recognition
2x + 3y = 13, 3x + 2y = 12
Notice the symmetry? Add: 5x + 5y = 25, so x + y = 5

---

### **TIPS FOR ACCURACY**

#### Accuracy Tip 1: Verify Using Substitution
After solving, substitute the answer back into the original equation.

#### Accuracy Tip 2: Check Sign Consistency
When moving terms across =, sign changes!
- 3x = 12 - 5 (not 12 + 5)

#### Accuracy Tip 3: Use Rough Estimation
If you get x = 127.3 but options are 12, 120, 125, 130
Your answer is likely wrong - recalculate!

#### Accuracy Tip 4: Track Negative Signs
Put parentheses: -(3x + 2) = -3x - 2 (not -3x + 2)

#### Accuracy Tip 5: Double-Check Factorization
Always multiply back: (x + 3)(x + 4) = x² + 7x + 12 ✓
