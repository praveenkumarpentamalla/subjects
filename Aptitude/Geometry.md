```
A______B
 \    
  \θ  
   \   
C___\___D
```

**Solution:**
- AB || CD, AC is transversal

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES & TRAPS

### **FREQUENT ERRORS STUDENTS MAKE**

#### **Error 1: Confusing Perimeter and Area Formulas**

❌ **Wrong:** Square area = 4 × side

✅ **Correct:**
- Perimeter = 4 × side
- Area = side²

**Trap Question:** "A square has side 10 cm. Find its area."
- Wrong answer: 40 cm (that's perimeter!)
- Correct: 100 cm²

---

#### **Error 2: Forgetting (1/2) in Triangle Area**

❌ **Wrong:** Area = base × height

✅ **Correct:** Area = (1/2) × base × height

**Why error happens:** Students remember rectangle (b×h) and forget triangle is half!

---

#### **Error 3: Using Diameter Instead of Radius**

❌ **Wrong:** Area of circle = πd²

✅ **Correct:** Area = πr² = π(d/2)² = πd²/4

**Trap:** "Circle has diameter 14 cm. Find area."
- Wrong: π × 14² = 616 (used d instead of r!)
- Correct: π × 7² = 154 cm²

---

#### **Error 4: Wrong Pythagorean Application**

❌ **Wrong:** (Base + Height)² = Hypotenuse²

✅ **Correct:** Base² + Height² = Hypotenuse²

**Example:** Base=3, Height=4
- Wrong: (3+4)² = 49 (incorrect formula!)
- Correct: 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25, so hypotenuse = 5

---

#### **Error 5: Diagonal Confusion in Rhombus**

❌ **Wrong:** Diagonals of rhombus are equal

✅ **Correct:** Diagonals of rhombus are perpendicular bisectors but NOT equal

**Who has equal diagonals:**
- Rectangle ✓
- Square ✓
- Rhombus ✗ (unless it's a square)

---

#### **Error 6: Angle Sum Confusion**

**Common mistakes:**
- Triangle sum = 360° (Wrong! It's 180°)
- Quadrilateral sum = 180° (Wrong! It's 360°)

**Memory:** "Three = 180, Four = 360" (multiply first digit by 60!)

Actually better: "Triangle = 180°, add 180° for each extra side"
- Triangle: 180°
- Quadrilateral: 180° + 180° = 360°
- Pentagon: 180° + 180° + 180° = 540°

---

#### **Error 7: Similar vs Congruent**

❌ **Wrong:** Similar triangles have equal sides

✅ **Correct:**
- **Similar:** Same shape, proportional sides
- **Congruent:** Identical, equal sides

---

### **TRICK QUESTIONS COMMONLY ASKED**

#### **Trick 1: The Impossible Triangle**

**Question:** "Can a triangle have sides 2 cm, 3 cm, and 7 cm?"

**Trap:** Students calculate area without checking validity!

**Check Triangle Inequality:**
- 2 + 3 = 5 < 7 ✗
- Triangle is IMPOSSIBLE!

**Rule:** Sum of any two sides must be > third side

---

#### **Trick 2: The Angle Trap**

**Question:** "One angle of triangle is 90°, another is 100°. Find the third."

**Trap:** 
- Third = 180° - 90° - 100° = -10°

**Reality:** Negative angle! Such triangle CANNOT exist!

---

#### **Trick 3: The Hidden Right Triangle**

**Question:** "Triangle has sides 9, 40, 41. Is it right-angled?"

**Trap:** Students don't recognize it as Pythagorean triplet

**Check:** 9² + 40² = 81 + 1600 = 1681 = 41² ✓

**It IS a right triangle!**

---

#### **Trick 4: The Rhombus-Square Confusion**

**Question:** "A rhombus has all sides 10 cm and one angle 90°. Find its area."

**Trap:** Using rhombus formula when it's actually a square!

**Reality:**
- Rhombus with one angle 90° → All angles 90°
- It's a SQUARE!
- Area = 10² = 100 cm²

---

#### **Trick 5: The Circle-Semicircle Area**

**Question:** "Diameter of semicircle is 14 cm. Find area."

**Trap:** Using full circle formula

**Correct:**
- Radius = 7 cm
- Full circle area = 154 cm²
- Semicircle = 154/2 = 77 cm²

---

#### **Trick 6: The Exterior Angle Misdirection**

**Question:** "Exterior angle of triangle is 120°. Find the adjacent interior angle."

**Trap:** Thinking it requires other angles

**Direct:** Exterior + Adjacent interior = 180° (linear pair)
- Interior = 180° - 120° = 60°

---

### **HOW TO AVOID CALCULATION MISTAKES**

#### **Strategy 1: Draw a Diagram ALWAYS**

Even for simple problems:
- Visual helps catch errors
- Shows relationships clearly
- Prevents formula confusion

---

#### **Strategy 2: Check Special Cases**

Before applying formulas:
- Is it a special triangle? (30-60-90, 45-45-90, or Pythagorean triplet?)
- Is it actually a square disguised as rhombus?
- Can the figure even exist?

---

#### **Strategy 3: Unit Consistency**

Always write units:
- 10 cm × 5 cm = 50 cm² (not just 50!)
- Helps catch when you mix up perimeter and area

---

#### **Strategy 4: Sanity Check**

After solving:
- Is area positive?
- Is area less than surrounding shape?
- Does answer make physical sense?

**Example:** Circle radius 7 cm
- Area ≈ 154 cm²
- Circumscribing square area = 196 cm²
- Circle area < Square area ✓ Makes sense!

---

#### **Strategy 5: Memorize Common Values**

**Pythagorean Triplets:**
- 3-4-5, 5-12-13, 8-15-17, 7-24-25

**Special Angles:**
- Equilateral: all 60°
- Square: all 90°
- Regular hexagon: all 120°

**Quick Recognition:** Saves calculation time and errors!

### **TIPS FOR SPEED AND ACCURACY**

#### **Speed Tips:**

**1. Memorize These Values**
```
√2 ≈ 1.414
√3 ≈ 1.732
π ≈ 3.14 or 22/7
(√3/4) ≈ 0.433
```

**2. Recognize Patterns Instantly**
- See 3,4,? → Think 5
- See 5,12,? → Think 13
- See 30° or 60° → Think special triangle
- See "regular hexagon" → Think 6 equilaterals

**3. Use Direct Formulas**
- Square diagonal: side√2 (don't use Pythagoras!)
- Equilateral area: (√3/4)side² (don't use base-height!)
- Rhombus area: (1/2)d₁d₂ (fastest method!)

**4. Eliminate Before Calculating**
- In MCQs, check which options are even possible
- Use approximation to eliminate

**Example:** Square side 9 cm, area = ?
- Options: (A) 72 (B) 81 (C) 90 (D) 36
- Must be perfect square → Eliminate (A) and (C)
- 9² = 81 → Answer (B)

**5. Practice Mental Math**
- 12² = 144
- 13² = 169
- 14² = 196
- 15² = 225
- 20² = 400

**6. Draw Quick Sketches**
- Even rough diagrams help
- Mark known values
- Visualize relationships

**7. Check Units in Question**
- If asking area, answer must be cm², not cm
- Helps avoid perimeter-area confusion

---

#### **Accuracy Tips:**

**1. Always Write the Formula First**
- Don't jump to calculation
- Write: "Area = (1/2) × b × h"
- Then substitute values
- Prevents formula errors

**2. Double-Check Special Cases**
- Before using general formula, check if it's:
  - Equilateral triangle?
  - Square (not just rhombus)?
  - Right triangle?
  - Pythagorean triplet?

**3. Verify Triangle Inequality**
- For any triangle problem with 3 sides given
- Quick check: sum of two smallest > largest
- Saves you from impossible triangles

**4. Mark Given Information Clearly**
- Circle what you need to find
- Underline given values
- Don't confuse radius with diameter!

**5. Use Estimation for Verification**
- Quick approximate answer
- If exact answer is way off → Recheck!

**Example:** Circle radius 10 cm, area = ?
- Estimate: 3 × 100 = 300 cm²
- Exact: 314 cm²
- Close enough ✓

**6. Watch for Unit Conversions**
- If diameter given in meters, radius in cm → Convert!
- Keep all in same unit

**7. Don't Rush the Last Step**
- Many errors happen in final calculation
- 25 × 12 = ? (Take 3 seconds to be sure!)
