# TIME AND DISTANCE: Complete Mastery Guide for Government Exams

## 1. FOUNDATION TO ADVANCED COVERAGE

### **BASIC CONCEPTS (Foundation Level)**

**Core Definitions:**

- **Distance** = Length of path traveled (measured in km, m, miles)
- **Speed** = Rate of covering distance (km/hr, m/s, mph)
- **Time** = Duration taken to cover distance (hours, minutes, seconds)

**Fundamental Relationship:**
```
Distance = Speed × Time
```

**Real-world Example:** If you drive at 60 km/hr for 2 hours, you cover 60 × 2 = 120 km.

---

#### **A. The Magic Triangle (DST Triangle)**

Visualize this triangle:

```
        D
       ___
      |   |
    S | × | T
      |___|
```

**From this triangle:**
- Distance = Speed × Time
- Speed = Distance / Time
- Time = Distance / Speed

**Memory Hook:** "DST = Distance is Speed Times Time"

---

#### **B. Unit Conversions (CRITICAL for Exams)**

**Speed Conversions:**

1. **km/hr to m/s:**
   ```
   km/hr × (5/18) = m/s
   ```
   Example: 36 km/hr = 36 × 5/18 = 10 m/s

2. **m/s to km/hr:**
   ```
   m/s × (18/5) = km/hr
   ```
   Example: 10 m/s = 10 × 18/5 = 36 km/hr

**Memory Hook:** "5/18 shrinks (km to m), 18/5 grows (m to km)"

**Why 5/18?**
- 1 km = 1000 m
- 1 hour = 3600 seconds
- 1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s = 5/18 m/s

---

#### **C. Relative Speed Concepts**

**Case 1: Same Direction**
```
Relative Speed = |Speed₁ - Speed₂|
```

**Example:** Car A at 60 km/hr, Car B at 50 km/hr (same direction)
- Relative speed = 60 - 50 = 10 km/hr
- **Meaning:** A gains 10 km on B every hour

**Case 2: Opposite Direction**
```
Relative Speed = Speed₁ + Speed₂
```

**Example:** Train A at 60 km/hr, Train B at 40 km/hr (opposite direction)
- Relative speed = 60 + 40 = 100 km/hr
- **Meaning:** They approach each other at 100 km/hr

**Real-world Visualization:**
- Same direction = Chase scenario (slower gap closure)
- Opposite direction = Head-on scenario (faster gap closure)

---

### **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TECHNIQUES**

#### **A. Average Speed**

**Formula (Most Important):**
```
Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time
```

**NOT the average of speeds!**

**Example:** Travel 60 km at 30 km/hr, return 60 km at 60 km/hr
❌ Wrong: Average = (30+60)/2 = 45 km/hr
✅ Correct:
- Total Distance = 120 km
- Time₁ = 60/30 = 2 hrs
- Time₂ = 60/60 = 1 hr
- Total Time = 3 hrs
- Average Speed = 120/3 = 40 km/hr

---

**Special Case: Equal Distances at Different Speeds**

When traveling equal distances at speeds S₁ and S₂:
```
Average Speed = (2 × S₁ × S₂) / (S₁ + S₂)
```

**This is the HARMONIC MEAN formula!**

**Example:** 100 km at 50 km/hr, return 100 km at 100 km/hr
- Average = (2 × 50 × 100)/(50 + 100) = 10000/150 = 66.67 km/hr

**Shortcut Memory:** "Two distances? Two on top! (2 × S₁ × S₂)"

---

**Special Case: Equal Times at Different Speeds**

When traveling for equal times at speeds S₁ and S₂:
```
Average Speed = (S₁ + S₂) / 2
```

**This is the ARITHMETIC MEAN!**

**Example:** Travel 1 hour at 40 km/hr, next 1 hour at 60 km/hr
- Average = (40 + 60)/2 = 50 km/hr

---

#### **B. Meeting Point Problems**

**Two people start from same point in opposite directions:**

```
Meeting Time = Total Distance / (Speed₁ + Speed₂)
```

**Example:** A and B start from a point, go in opposite directions at 40 and 60 km/hr. When are they 500 km apart?
- Time = 500/(40+60) = 500/100 = 5 hours

---

**Two people start from different points toward each other:**

```
Meeting Time = Distance Between / (Speed₁ + Speed₂)
Meeting Distance from A = Speed₁ × Meeting Time
```

**Example:** A and B are 300 km apart. A travels at 40 km/hr, B at 60 km/hr toward each other.
- Meeting time = 300/(40+60) = 3 hours
- A travels = 40 × 3 = 120 km
- B travels = 60 × 3 = 180 km

---

#### **C. Catching Up Problems (Same Direction)**

**Formula:**
```
Time to catch up = Distance Gap / (Faster Speed - Slower Speed)
```

**Example:** Car A is 50 km ahead, traveling at 60 km/hr. Car B starts from behind at 80 km/hr.
- Time = 50/(80-60) = 50/20 = 2.5 hours

---

### **ADVANCED PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES**

#### **A. Train Problems**

**Type 1: Train Crossing a Pole/Person**

```
Time = Length of Train / Speed of Train
```

**Example:** 200m train at 72 km/hr crosses a pole
- Speed = 72 × 5/18 = 20 m/s
- Time = 200/20 = 10 seconds

**Why?** Pole has no length, only train length matters.

---

**Type 2: Train Crossing a Platform/Bridge**

```
Time = (Length of Train + Length of Platform) / Speed
```

**Example:** 200m train crosses 300m platform at 72 km/hr
- Speed = 20 m/s
- Time = (200+300)/20 = 25 seconds

---

**Type 3: Two Trains Crossing Each Other**

**Opposite Direction:**
```
Time = (Length₁ + Length₂) / (Speed₁ + Speed₂)
```

**Same Direction:**
```
Time = (Length₁ + Length₂) / |Speed₁ - Speed₂|
```

**Example:** Train A (150m) at 72 km/hr, Train B (100m) at 36 km/hr, opposite direction
- Speed₁ = 20 m/s, Speed₂ = 10 m/s
- Time = (150+100)/(20+10) = 250/30 = 8.33 seconds

---

#### **B. Boat and Stream Problems**

**Fundamental Concepts:**

```
Downstream Speed = Boat Speed + Stream Speed
Upstream Speed = Boat Speed - Stream Speed
```

**Key Formulas:**

1. **Boat Speed in Still Water:**
   ```
   Boat Speed = (Downstream + Upstream) / 2
   ```

2. **Stream Speed:**
   ```
   Stream Speed = (Downstream - Upstream) / 2
   ```

**Example:** Boat travels 20 km/hr downstream, 10 km/hr upstream
- Boat speed = (20+10)/2 = 15 km/hr
- Stream speed = (20-10)/2 = 5 km/hr

**Memory Hook:** "D+U divide 2 = Boat, D-U divide 2 = Stream"

---

**Special Pattern: Ratio Method**

If downstream:upstream = a:b, then:
```
Boat : Stream = (a+b) : (a-b)
```

**Example:** Down:Up = 5:3
- Boat:Stream = (5+3):(5-3) = 8:2 = 4:1

---

#### **C. Races**

**Type 1: A beats B by Distance**

"A beats B by 100m" means when A finishes the race, B is 100m behind.

**Formula:**
```
Speed Ratio (A:B) = Race Distance : (Race Distance - Beat Distance)
```

**Example:** In 1 km race, A beats B by 100m
- A:B = 1000:900 = 10:9

---

**Type 2: A beats B by Time**

"A beats B by 10 seconds" means A finishes 10 seconds before B.

**Formula:**
```
Time Ratio (A:B) = A's Time : (A's Time + Beat Time)
```

**Example:** In a race, A finishes in 100 seconds, beats B by 10 seconds
- A:B time = 100:110 = 10:11
- Speed ratio = 11:10 (inverse of time)

---

**Type 3: A gives B a head start of x meters**

B starts x meters ahead.

**Example:** 500m race, A gives B 50m start, both finish together
- A runs 500m, B runs 450m in same time
- Speed ratio A:B = 500:450 = 10:9

---

#### **D. Circular Track Problems**

**Meeting Points on Circular Track:**

**Same Direction:**
```
Time between meetings = Circumference / |Speed₁ - Speed₂|
```

**Opposite Direction:**
```
Time between meetings = Circumference / (Speed₁ + Speed₂)
```

**Example:** 400m circular track, A at 5 m/s, B at 3 m/s
- Same direction: 400/(5-3) = 200 seconds between meetings
- Opposite direction: 400/(5+3) = 50 seconds between meetings

---

**First Meeting Distance:**

**Opposite direction:** They meet after covering total circumference together.
```
Distance by A = (Speed_A / (Speed_A + Speed_B)) × Circumference
```

---

   ```

---

#### **C. Meeting and Catching Up**

   ```
   Time = Distance / (S₁ + S₂)
   ```

9. **Catching Up Time (Same Direction):**
   ```
   Time = Distance Gap / (S₁ - S₂)
   ```

10. **Meeting Point from A:**
    ```
    Distance = Speed_A × Meeting Time
    ```

---

#### **D. Train Formulas**

11. **Train Crossing Pole:**
    ```
    Time = Length of Train / Speed
    ```

12. **Train Crossing Platform:**
    ```
    Time = (Train Length + Platform Length) / Speed
    ```

13. **Two Trains Crossing:**
    ```
    Opposite: Time = (L₁ + L₂) / (S₁ + S₂)
    Same: Time = (L₁ + L₂) / |S₁ - S₂|
    ```

---

#### **E. Boat and Stream**

    Downstream = Boat + Stream
    Upstream = Boat - Stream
    ```

15. **Boat and Stream from D & U:**
    ```
    Boat = (D + U) / 2
    Stream = (D - U) / 2
    ```

16. **Time Ratio (Up:Down):**
    ```
    Time Up : Time Down = Downstream : Upstream
    ```

---

#### **F. Races**

    Speed Ratio = Race Distance : (Race - Beat)
    ```

18. **Head Start:**
    ```
    Speed Ratio = Distance by A : Distance by B
    ```

---

### **TIME-SAVING SHORTCUTS**

#### **Shortcut 1: Fast km/hr ↔ m/s Conversion**

**Mental Trick:**

**km/hr to m/s:** Divide by 3.6 (or multiply by 5/18)
- 36 km/hr → 36/3.6 = 10 m/s
- 72 km/hr → 72/3.6 = 20 m/s
- 90 km/hr → 90/3.6 = 25 m/s

**Common Values to Memorize:**
- 18 km/hr = 5 m/s
- 36 km/hr = 10 m/s
- 54 km/hr = 15 m/s
- 72 km/hr = 20 m/s
- 90 km/hr = 25 m/s

**Pattern:** Add 18 to km/hr, add 5 to m/s!

---

#### **Shortcut 2: Quick Average Speed (Equal Distances)**

**When traveling two equal distances at S₁ and S₂:**

Instead of full calculation, use:
```
Average = Product/Average of speeds × 2
```

**Example:** 40 km/hr and 60 km/hr
- Product = 2400
- Sum = 100
- Average speed = 2400/100 × 2 = 48 km/hr

**Or direct formula:** (2 × 40 × 60)/(40+60) = 4800/100 = 48 km/hr

---

#### **Shortcut 3: Fractional Speed Method**

**Pattern Recognition:**

If speed increases/decreases by fraction:
```
New Time = Old Time × (Old Speed / New Speed)
```

**Example:** Journey takes 10 hours at 60 km/hr. Time at 80 km/hr?
- New time = 10 × (60/80) = 10 × 3/4 = 7.5 hours

**Mental:** Speed up by 1/3 → Time down by 1/4

---

#### **Shortcut 4: Meeting Point (Quick Ratio)**

**When two people meet:**
```
Distance ratio = Speed ratio
```

**Example:** A at 40 km/hr, B at 60 km/hr, start 500 km apart
- Speed ratio = 2:3
- Distance ratio = 2:3
- A covers (2/5) × 500 = 200 km
- B covers (3/5) × 500 = 300 km

---

#### **Shortcut 5: Train Length (Quick Find)**

**Given:** Train crosses pole in t₁ seconds, crosses platform in t₂ seconds

```
Platform Length = (t₂ - t₁) × Speed
Train Length = t₁ × Speed
```

**Example:** Pole in 10s, 500m platform in 30s
- Speed = 500/(30-10) = 500/20 = 25 m/s
- Train length = 10 × 25 = 250m

---

#### **Shortcut 6: Boat-Stream (Instant Find)**

**If given:** Distance, time downstream, time upstream

```
Speed ratio (Down:Up) = Time ratio (Up:Down)
```

**Example:** 60 km in 3 hrs downstream, 6 hrs upstream
- Down speed = 60/3 = 20 km/hr
- Up speed = 60/6 = 10 km/hr
- Boat = 15 km/hr, Stream = 5 km/hr

---

#### **Shortcut 7: Race Winner (Quick Method)**

**Pattern:** If A:B speed = m:n
```
In distance D, A beats B by D × (m-n)/m
```

**Example:** 1000m race, speed ratio 5:4
- Beat distance = 1000 × (5-4)/5 = 1000/5 = 200m

---

### **ALTERNATIVE METHODS COMPARISON**

**Problem:** A covers 300 km in 5 hours. B covers same distance in 6 hours. When will B catch up if A has 60 km head start?

**Method 1: Traditional**
- A's speed = 300/5 = 60 km/hr
- B's speed = 300/6 = 50 km/hr
- Wait... B is slower! B will NEVER catch up!

---

**Corrected Problem:** When will A catch B if B has 60 km head start?
- Relative speed = 60-50 = 10 km/hr
- Time = 60/10 = 6 hours

**Method 2: Ratio Method**
- Speed ratio = 60:50 = 6:5
- Difference = 1 unit = 10 km/hr
- Time = 60/10 = 6 hours

**Method 3: Direct Formula**
- Time = Gap / (Faster - Slower) = 60/(60-50) = 6 hours

**Best for Exam:** Method 3 (10 seconds!)

---

### **WHEN TO USE WHICH METHOD**

---

## 3. MEMORY TECHNIQUES

### **MNEMONICS FOR FORMULAS**

#### **A. "DST" - Distance, Speed, Time**
```
D = S × T
```
**Memory:** "Don't Stop Trying" = DST = Distance = Speed × Time

---

#### **B. "5-18" Conversion**
```
km/hr × 5/18 = m/s
```
**Memory:** "Five-Eighteen shrinks the speed" (km to m is smaller units)

**Visual:** 5 fingers, 18 hours in a day → 5/18

---

#### **C. "D+U, D-U" for Boats**
```
Boat = (D+U)/2
Stream = (D-U)/2
```
**Memory:** "Down-Up gives Boat, Down-Up DIfference gives Stream"
- DU for boat (friendly letters)
- DI for stream (difference)

---

#### **D. "Harmonic for Distance, Arithmetic for Time"**
```
Equal distances → 2S₁S₂/(S₁+S₂)
Equal times → (S₁+S₂)/2
```
**Memory:** "Distance is HARD (harmonic), Time is EASY (arithmetic)"

---

#### **E. "Plus for Opposite, Minus for Same"**
```
Opposite direction → S₁ + S₂
Same direction → S₁ - S₂
```
**Memory:** "Opposites attract (+), Same repel (-)"

---

### **VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES**

#### **A. The Number Line Method**

For meeting/catching problems, visualize a number line:

```
A(60 km/hr) ←---500km---→ B(40 km/hr)
    ←---------------------→
        Meeting point
```

**Mental Steps:**
1. Draw line with distance
2. Mark speeds
3. Calculate: 500/(60+40) = 5 hours
4. A's distance: 60×5 = 300 km from start

---

#### **B. The Train Visualization**

For train problems, draw the train and object:

```
Train crossing pole:
|----200m----|  •pole
     →→→ (speed)
```

```
Train crossing platform:
|----200m----| |----300m----|
     →→→ (total = 500m to cross)
```

---

#### **C. The River Flow Visual**

For boat-stream:

```
Downstream: →→→ (boat) + → (stream) = →→→→
Upstream: →→→ (boat) - ← (stream) = →→
```

**Mental:** More arrows downstream = faster!

---

#### **D. The Circular Track**

```
     A(fast)→
   ●━━━━━━━━●
   ↑        ↓
   ●        ●
   ↓        ↑
   ●━━━━━━━━●
        ←B(slow)
```

Same direction: A gains on B slowly
Opposite: They meet quickly

---

### **PATTERN RECOGNITION TIPS**

#### **Pattern 1: Unit Matching**

**If question has:**
- Distance in km, speed in km/hr → Time in hours ✓
- Distance in m, speed in m/s → Time in seconds ✓
- **Mixed units** → CONVERT FIRST! ⚠️

---

#### **Pattern 2: Impossible Scenarios**

**Red Flags:**
- Slower person catching faster (same direction) → NEVER
- Upstream faster than downstream → IMPOSSIBLE
- Negative time/speed/distance → ERROR in calculation

---

#### **Pattern 3: Symmetry Recognition**

**When you see:**
- "Goes and returns" → Equal distances (use harmonic mean)
- "Each traveled for 2 hours" → Equal times (use arithmetic mean)
- "A and B start toward each other" → Add speeds

---

#### **Pattern 4: Keyword Triggers**

| Keyword | Action |
|---------|--------|
| "overtakes" | Same direction, subtract speeds |
| "meet" | Opposite direction, add speeds |
| "average speed" | Total distance / Total time |
| "crosses" (train) | Add lengths |
| "upstream/downstream" | Add/subtract stream |
| "beats by" (race) | Speed ratio |

---

### **MEMORY HOOKS THAT LAST LIFELONG**

#### **Hook 1: "The 5/18 Finger Rule"**

Hold up 5 fingers on one hand, imagine 18 on the other.
> "5 small fingers shrink km to m, 18 big fingers grow m to km"

---

#### **Hook 2: "The River Always Helps or Hurts"**

Downstream = Help (+), Upstream = Hurt (-)
> "Rivers are friends going down, enemies going up"

---

#### **Hook 3: "Fast Friends, Slow Enemies"**

Opposite direction = Fast meeting (add speeds)
Same direction = Slow catching (subtract speeds)
> "Friends rush to meet (+), enemies avoid each other (-)"

---

#### **Hook 4: "The Average Speed Trap"**

Never average speeds directly!
> "Speeds are liars - only distance and time tell truth"

---

#### **Hook 5: "Train Length is the Key"**

For all train problems:
> "Pole = Just train, Platform = Train plus friend"

---

#### **Hook 6: "Race Ratios Reverse"**

Speed ratio = Time ratio REVERSED
> "Fast runners take less time - it's opposite!"

---

**Q9. [IBPS PO 2020]**
A car traveling at 40 km/hr can complete a journey in 9 hours. How much time will it save if speed is increased to 60 km/hr?

**Solution:**
- Distance = 40 × 9 = 360 km
- New time = 360/60 = 6 hours
- Time saved = 9 - 6 = 3 hours

**Shortcut (Ratio Method):**
- Speed ratio = 40:60 = 2:3
- Time ratio = 3:2 (inverse)
- If old time = 9, new time = 9 × (2/3) = 6 hours
- Saved = 3 hours

**Answer:** 3 hours

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES & TRAPS

### **FREQUENT ERRORS STUDENTS MAKE**

#### **Error 1: Unit Confusion**

❌ **Wrong:** Distance = 120 km, Speed = 20 m/s, Time = 120/20 = 6 units (what unit?!)

✅ **Correct:** Convert first!
- Speed = 20 m/s = 20 × 18/5 = 72 km/hr
- Time = 120/72 = 1.67 hours

**Rule:** Always match units before calculating!

---

#### **Error 2: Averaging Speeds Directly**

❌ **Wrong:** Travel at 40 and 60 km/hr → Average = (40+60)/2 = 50 km/hr

✅ **Correct:** Depends on conditions!
- Equal distances → Harmonic mean = 48 km/hr
- Equal times → Arithmetic mean = 50 km/hr

**Trap:** Exams specifically test this confusion!

---

#### **Error 3: Relative Speed Direction**

❌ **Wrong:** Opposite direction → Subtract speeds

✅ **Correct:**
- Opposite direction → ADD speeds (they meet faster)
- Same direction → SUBTRACT speeds (slow catching)

**Memory:** "Opposites attract (+)"

---

#### **Error 4: Train Length Problems**

❌ **Wrong:** Train crossing 500m platform in 25s at 20 m/s → Platform = 500m ✓

✅ **Correct:** Total distance = Train + Platform
- Distance = 20 × 25 = 500m
- If train = 150m, then Platform = 500 - 150 = 350m

---

#### **Error 5: Boat-Stream Confusion**

❌ **Wrong:** Downstream = Boat - Stream

✅ **Correct:**
- Downstream = Boat + Stream (going WITH current)
- Upstream = Boat - Stream (going AGAINST current)

**Visual:** Stream helps downstream, hurts upstream

---

#### **Error 6: Percentage Speed Changes**

**Trap:** "Speed increases by 20%, what happens to time?"

❌ **Wrong:** Time decreases by 20%

✅ **Correct:**
- New speed = 1.2 × Old speed
- New time = Old time / 1.2 = Old time × (5/6)
- Decrease = 1 - 5/6 = 1/6 = 16.67%

**Formula:** If speed increases by x%, time decreases by [x/(100+x)] × 100%

---

#### **Error 7: Calculation with Fractions**

**Common:** 5/18 × 72 = ?

❌ **Wrong:** 5 × 72 / 18 = 360/18 = 20... wait, that's right!

But students often mess up: (5/18) × 72

**Tip:** Cancel first! 72/18 = 4, then 5 × 4 = 20

---

### **TRICK QUESTIONS COMMONLY ASKED**

#### **Trick 1: The Zero Net Movement**

**Question:** "A boat goes 24 km upstream in 3 hours and 24 km downstream in 2 hours. What's the speed of the stream?"

**Trap:** Students think boat travels 48 km total.

**Reality:** 
- Up = 24/3 = 8 km/hr
- Down = 24/2 = 12 km/hr
- Stream = (12-8)/2 = 2 km/hr

---

#### **Trick 2: The Meeting Point Reversal**

**Question:** "A and B start toward each other 100 km apart at 20 and 30 km/hr. Where do they meet?"

**Trap:** Calculating wrong starting point.

**Correct:**
- Meet after 100/50 = 2 hours
- A travels 20 × 2 = 40 km from A's start
- B travels 30 × 2 = 60 km from B's start
- Check: 40 + 60 = 100 ✓

---

#### **Trick 3: The Impossible Catch**

**Question:** "A is 50 km ahead traveling at 60 km/hr. B starts at 50 km/hr. When does B catch A?"

**Trap:** Setting up catch-up formula

**Reality:** B is SLOWER! B will NEVER catch A!

**Check your assumptions!**

---

#### **Trick 4: The Word Problem Trap**

**Question:** "A train overtakes a person walking at 6 km/hr in the same direction in 10 seconds. Train length?"

**Missing Info:** Train's speed not given! Problem unsolvable!

**Watch for:** Missing variables in word problems

---

#### **Trick 5: The Units Trap**

**Question:** "A car at 20 m/s covers 3.6 km. Time taken?"

**Trap:** Mixing m/s with km

**Correct Method 1:** Convert speed
- 20 m/s = 72 km/hr
- Time = 3.6/72 = 0.05 hours = 3 minutes

**Correct Method 2:** Convert distance
- 3.6 km = 3600m
- Time = 3600/20 = 180 seconds = 3 minutes

---

### **HOW TO AVOID CALCULATION MISTAKES**

#### **Strategy 1: Write Units Always**

Instead of: 120/40 = 3
Write: 120 km / 40 km/hr = 3 hours

**Benefit:** Units guide you to correct answer!

---

#### **Strategy 2: Quick Reality Check**

After solving, ask:
- Does answer make sense?
- Is time positive?
- Is speed reasonable? (Not 500 km/hr for a car!)
- Do units match what's asked?

---

#### **Strategy 3: Use Approximation**

Before exact calculation:
- 118 km / 23 km/hr ≈ 120/24 = 5 hours
- If your exact answer is 12 hours → ERROR!

---

#### **Strategy 4: Convert Early**

Don't wait till the end to convert units.
- Convert ALL to same unit at start
- Calculate
- Answer is already in right unit!

---

#### **Strategy 5: Recognize Common Values**

Memorize:
- 18 km/hr = 5 m/s
- 36 km/hr = 10 m/s
- 54 km/hr = 15 m/s
- 72 km/hr = 20 m/s

**Saves time and reduces errors!**

- Saves 10-15 seconds per problem!

**2. Use Direct Formulas**
- Two equal distances → (2S₁S₂)/(S₁+S₂) [One step!]
- Don't calculate time separately

**3. Simplify Before Multiplying**
- Instead of: (5/18) × 72 = 360/18 = 20
- Do: Cancel 18: 5 × (72/18) = 5 × 4 = 20

**4. Pattern Recognition**
- "Toward each other" → Add speeds instantly
- "Same direction" → Subtract speeds instantly
- Don't waste time reading again

**5. Skip Complex Calculations**
- If you see 127 × 83 /314, skip and come back later
- Do easier problems first

**6. Use Options (MCQs)**
- Sometimes back-calculating from options is faster
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers first

**7. Mental Math for Common Operations**
- 1/2 = 50%, 1/3 = 33.33%, 1/4 = 25%
- Know these instantly

---

#### **Accuracy Tips:**

**1. Write Units**
- 60 km / 20 km/hr = 3 hours (not just 3!)
- Units prevent mistakes

**2. Double-Check Direction**
- Opposite → + speeds
- Same → - speeds
- Verify before calculating

**3. Verify Final Answer**
- Does it match question's unit?
- Is it reasonable?
- Is it among options?

**4. Watch for Traps**
- "Increased by 50%" → New = 1.5 × Old
- "Increased to 50%" → New = 0.5 × Original (different!)

**5. Don't Skip Steps Mentally**
- Write at least key values
- Prevents silly mistakes

**6. Cross-Check with Different Method**
- If time permits, verify using alternate formula
- Especially for high-value questions

**7. Practice Common Errors**
- Make a list of your recurring mistakes
