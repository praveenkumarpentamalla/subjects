# MASTERING PROFIT AND LOSS FOR COMPETITIVE GOVERNMENT EXAMS

## 1. FOUNDATION TO ADVANCED COVERAGE

### **BASIC CONCEPTS & DEFINITIONS**

**Cost Price (CP):** The price at which an article is purchased.

**Selling Price (SP):** The price at which an article is sold.

**Profit:** When SP > CP
- Profit = SP - CP

**Loss:** When CP > SP
- Loss = CP - SP

**Marked Price (MP):** The price printed on the article (list price).

**Discount:** Reduction given on the marked price.
- Discount = MP - SP

**Real-world example:** You buy a phone for ₹10,000 (CP), the shopkeeper has marked it at ₹15,000 (MP), gives you ₹2,000 discount, so you pay ₹13,000 (SP). His profit = ₹3,000.

### **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TECHNIQUES**

**Successive Discounts:** When multiple discounts are applied one after another.

**False Weights:** Shopkeeper uses faulty weights to cheat.

**Dishonest Dealings:** Mixing cheaper and costlier items, or buying at one rate and selling at another while claiming different weights.

**Partnership in Business:** Multiple people invest in a business and share profit/loss.

### **ADVANCED PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES**

**Transaction-based Problems:** Multiple buying and selling operations.

**Replacement of Items:** Shopkeeper replaces good quality with bad quality.

**Percentage Change Problems:** Finding overall effect when prices fluctuate.

## 2. ALL IMPORTANT FORMULAS & SHORTCUTS

### **BASIC FORMULAS**

**1. Profit Percentage:**
```
Profit% = (Profit/CP) × 100
Profit% = [(SP - CP)/CP] × 100
```

**2. Loss Percentage:**
```
Loss% = (Loss/CP) × 100
Loss% = [(CP - SP)/CP] × 100
```

**3. Finding SP when CP and Profit% are given:**
```
SP = CP × (100 + Profit%)/100
```

**4. Finding SP when CP and Loss% are given:**
```
SP = CP × (100 - Loss%)/100
```

**5. Finding CP when SP and Profit% are given:**
```
CP = SP × 100/(100 + Profit%)
```

**6. Finding CP when SP and Loss% are given:**
```
CP = SP × 100/(100 - Loss%)
```

### **DISCOUNT FORMULAS**

**7. Discount Percentage:**
```
Discount% = (Discount/MP) × 100
```

**8. SP after Discount:**
```
SP = MP × (100 - Discount%)/100
```

**9. Successive Discounts (D₁% followed by D₂%):**
```
Net Discount% = D₁ + D₂ - (D₁ × D₂)/100
```

**For three discounts:**
```
Net% = D₁ + D₂ + D₃ - (D₁D₂ + D₂D₃ + D₃D₁)/100 + (D₁D₂D₃)/10000
```

### **GOLDEN SHORTCUTS**

**SHORTCUT 1: Percentage to Fraction Conversion**
- 10% = 1/10
- 20% = 1/5
- 25% = 1/4
- 33⅓% = 1/3
- 50% = 1/2
- 66⅔% = 2/3

**SHORTCUT 2: Quick SP Calculation**
If Profit% = 25%, then SP = CP × 5/4 (faster than calculating 125/100)

**SHORTCUT 3: Ratio Method**
If an article is sold at a profit of 20%:
- CP : SP = 100 : 120 = 5 : 6

If sold at a loss of 20%:
- CP : SP = 100 : 80 = 5 : 4

**SHORTCUT 4: When Two Items are Sold at Same SP**

One at x% profit and another at x% loss:
```
Overall Loss% = (x/10)²
```
(Always a loss, remember this!)

**Example:** One item at 10% profit, another at 10% loss
- Overall loss = (10/10)² = 1%

**SHORTCUT 5: False Weight Formula**

If a shopkeeper uses weight 'x' gm instead of 1000 gm:
```
Profit% = [(1000 - x)/x] × 100
```

**SHORTCUT 6: Dishonest Dealer**

Claims to sell at CP but uses false weight:
```
Profit% = [(True Weight - False Weight)/False Weight] × 100
```

**SHORTCUT 7: Successive Discounts Quick Method**

For 20% and 10% discounts:
- Think: 80% of 80% = 0.8 × 0.9 = 0.72 = 72%
- So net price = 72% of MP
- Discount = 28%

**SHORTCUT 8: MP to CP Relationship**

If MP is x% above CP and discount is y%:
```
Profit% = [(100 + x)(100 - y)/100] - 100
```

**SHORTCUT 9: Percentage Change**

If price increases by x% then decreases by x%:
```
Net change = -x²/100 (always a decrease)
```

**SHORTCUT 10: Break-Even Analysis**

To have no profit no loss after giving discount on marked price:
```
If MP is x% above CP, maximum discount that can be given = x/(100 + x) × 100
```

## 3. MEMORY TECHNIQUES

### **MNEMONICS FOR FORMULAS**

**"Please Stop Calling People"** for basic profit/loss:
- **P**rofit = **S**P - **C**P
- **P**rofit% = (Profit/**C**P) × 100 (Remember: CP is in denominator for percentage)

**"Some Students Can't Pass"** for finding SP:
- **S**P = **C**P × (100 ± **P**rofit/Loss%)

**"Can Someone Please Share"** for finding CP:
- **C**P = **S**P × 100/(100 ± profit/loss%)

### **VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES**

**Number Line Visualization:**
```
Loss ←──── 100 (CP) ────→ Profit
   80      90   100  110   120
  (20%L)  (10%L) CP (10%P) (20%P)
```

**For Successive Discounts:** Imagine a staircase going down
- First discount takes you to first step
- Second discount works on that reduced amount (not original)

### **PATTERN RECOGNITION TIPS**

**The "Same SP Different Profit/Loss" Pattern:**
When you see "two articles sold at same SP, one at x% profit, other at x% loss" → Always results in loss = (x/10)²%

**The "False Weight" Pattern:**
Whenever you see weights like 800g, 900g, 950g instead of 1000g → Use the false weight formula directly.

**The "Successive Discount" Pattern:**
Two discounts never add up directly. 20% + 10% ≠ 30%
- Remember: Total is always less than simple sum

### **MEMORY HOOKS THAT LAST LIFELONG**

**Hook 1: "The SP-CP Relationship"**
Think of a see-saw:
- SP up, CP down = Profit
- CP up, SP down = Loss

**Hook 2: "The 100 Rule"**
Every percentage formula has 100 in it. CP is your base (100), everything is calculated from there.

**Hook 3: "Discount is a Gift"**
Discount always reduces from Marked Price to reach Selling Price. It's a gift to customer from seller.

**Hook 4: "Successive = Multiplication"**
Successive discounts multiply, they don't add.
- 20% off then 10% off = 0.8 × 0.9 = 0.72 (28% total discount)

**Hook 5: "Same Selling = Loss Ball"**
When two items sold at same SP with equal profit% and loss%, you're always in the loss (like dropping a ball - it falls!)

## 4. GOVERNMENT EXAM PREVIOUS YEAR QUESTIONS (15-20)

### **BASIC LEVEL (Questions 1-5)**

**Q1. (SSC CGL 2019)** A shopkeeper bought an article for ₹500 and sold it for ₹600. What is the profit percentage?

**Method 1 (Formula):**
- Profit = 600 - 500 = ₹100
- Profit% = (100/500) × 100 = 20%

**Method 2 (Ratio - Fastest for exam):**
- CP : SP = 500 : 600 = 5 : 6
- Difference = 1 unit = 20%
- **Answer: 20%** ⏱️ 15 seconds

---

**Q2. (Railway NTPC 2016)** An article is sold for ₹720 at a loss of 10%. Find the CP.

**Method 1 (Formula):**
- CP = SP × 100/(100 - Loss%)
- CP = 720 × 100/90 = ₹800

**Method 2 (Ratio - Best):**
- CP : SP = 100 : 90 = 10 : 9
- 9 units = 720, so 1 unit = 80
- 10 units = 800
- **Answer: ₹800** ⏱️ 20 seconds

---

**Q3. (SBI PO 2018)** A trader marks his goods 30% above CP and gives a discount of 10%. Find his profit%.

**Method 1 (Direct Formula):**
- Profit% = [(100 + 30)(100 - 10)/100] - 100
- = [(130 × 90)/100] - 100
- = 117 - 100 = 17%

**Method 2 (Assume CP = 100):**
- CP = 100, MP = 130
- SP = 130 × 90/100 = 117
- Profit = 17%
- **Answer: 17%** ⏱️ 25 seconds

---

**Q4. (SSC CHSL 2020)** Find the single discount equivalent to successive discounts of 20% and 10%.

**Method 1 (Formula - Fastest):**
- Net Discount% = 20 + 10 - (20 × 10)/100
- = 30 - 2 = 28%

**Method 2 (Multiplication):**
- Net price = 80% of 90% = 0.8 × 0.9 = 0.72 = 72% of original
- Discount = 28%
- **Answer: 28%** ⏱️ 15 seconds

---

**Q5. (IBPS Clerk 2019)** A shopkeeper sells an article at 25% profit. If he had bought it at 20% less and sold for ₹10.50 less, he would have gained 30%. Find the CP.

**Method (Equation):**
Let CP = x
- Original SP = 1.25x
- New CP = 0.8x
- New SP = 1.25x - 10.50
- According to condition: (1.25x - 10.50) = 1.3 × 0.8x
- 1.25x - 10.50 = 1.04x
- 0.21x = 10.50
- x = 50
- **Answer: ₹50** ⏱️ 45 seconds

---

### **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (Questions 6-12)**

**Q6. (SSC CGL 2018)** A person sold two articles for ₹4000 each. On one he gained 25% and on the other he lost 20%. What is his overall gain or loss percentage?

**Method (Same SP Formula - Fastest):**
- When sold at same SP with x% profit and y% loss:
- Overall% = [(x - y) - (xy/100)] on total investment
- But here x ≠ y, so calculate separately:

For 25% profit: CP₁ = 4000 × 100/125 = ₹3200
For 20% loss: CP₂ = 4000 × 100/80 = ₹5000
- Total CP = 8200, Total SP = 8000
- Loss = 200
- Loss% = (200/8200) × 100 = 2.44%
- **Answer: 2.44% loss** ⏱️ 40 seconds

---

**Q7. (Railway RRB 2019)** A shopkeeper uses a weight of 800g instead of 1 kg. Find his profit percentage.

**Method (Direct Formula - Fastest):**
- Profit% = [(1000 - 800)/800] × 100
- = (200/800) × 100 = 25%
- **Answer: 25%** ⏱️ 10 seconds

---

**Q8. (IBPS PO 2017)** A dealer marks his goods 40% above CP and allows a discount of 25%. What is his gain percentage?

**Method (Assume CP = 100):**
- CP = 100
- MP = 140
- SP = 140 × 75/100 = 105
- Profit = 5%
- **Answer: 5%** ⏱️ 20 seconds

---

**Q9. (SSC CGL 2020)** If the cost price of 12 pens equals the selling price of 10 pens, find the profit percentage.

**Method (Ratio - Fastest):**
- 12 CP = 10 SP
- CP : SP = 10 : 12 = 5 : 6
- Profit = 1 unit on 5 units
- Profit% = (1/5) × 100 = 20%
- **Answer: 20%** ⏱️ 15 seconds

---

**Q10. (SBI Clerk 2021)** A man buys an article at 25% discount on the marked price. He sells it at 20% above the marked price. What is his profit percentage?

**Method (Assume MP = 100):**
- MP = 100
- CP (at 25% discount) = 75
- SP (at 20% above MP) = 120
- Profit = 45 on CP of 75
- Profit% = (45/75) × 100 = 60%
- **Answer: 60%** ⏱️ 25 seconds

---

**Q11. (Railway NTPC 2020)** Two articles are sold at ₹5000 each. One at 25% profit and the other at 25% loss. Find the overall profit or loss.

**Method (Special Formula - Fastest):**
- When two items sold at same SP with equal profit% and loss%:
- Overall Loss% = (x/10)²
- = (25/10)² = 6.25%
- **Answer: 6.25% loss** ⏱️ 10 seconds

---

**Q12. (IBPS RRB 2019)** A trader allows a discount of 10% on marked price. What percent above the cost price must he mark his goods to gain 8%?

**Method (Formula):**
- Let MP be x% above CP
- SP = CP × (100 + x)/100 × 90/100
- For 8% profit: SP = 1.08 CP
- 1.08 = (100 + x) × 0.9/100
- 108 = (100 + x) × 0.9
- 120 = 100 + x
- x = 20%
- **Answer: 20%** ⏱️ 35 seconds

---

### **ADVANCED LEVEL (Questions 13-20)**

- x = 200
- **Answer: ₹200** ⏱️ 30 seconds

---

**Q15. (Railway RRB 2018)** A dishonest dealer professes to sell at cost price but uses a weight of 900g for 1 kg. His gain percentage is:

**Method (Formula):**
- Profit% = [(1000 - 900)/900] × 100
- = (100/900) × 100 = 11.11%
- **Answer: 11.11%** ⏱️ 15 seconds

---

**Q16. (IBPS Clerk 2020)** A shopkeeper marks his goods at 50% above cost price and gives a discount such that he gains 25%. What is the discount percentage?

**Method:**
- Let CP = 100
- MP = 150
- For 25% profit, SP = 125
- Discount = 150 - 125 = 25
- Discount% = (25/150) × 100 = 16.67%
- **Answer: 16.67%** ⏱️ 30 seconds

---

**Q17. (SSC CHSL 2021)** The price of an article is increased by 20% and then decreased by 20%. What is the net percentage change?

**Method (Formula - Fastest):**

- = -(20)²/100 = -4%
- **Answer: 4% decrease** ⏱️ 10 seconds

---

**Q18. (SBI Clerk 2019)** A trader sold an article at 10% loss. If he had sold it for ₹20 more, he would have gained 10%. Find the cost price of the article.

**Method:**
- Let CP = x
- At 10% loss: SP₁ = 0.9x
- At 10% profit: SP₂ = 1.1x
- 1.1x - 0.9x = 20
- 0.2x = 20
- x = 100
- **Answer: ₹100** ⏱️ 25 seconds

---

**Q19. (Railway NTPC 2021)** If selling price is doubled, the profit triples. Find the profit percentage.

**Method:**
Let CP = x, original SP = y
- Original profit = y - x
- New SP = 2y
- New profit = 2y - x = 3(y - x)
- 2y - x = 3y - 3x
- 2x = y
- Original profit = 2x - x = x
- Profit% = (x/x) × 100 = 100%
- **Answer: 100%** ⏱️ 40 seconds

---

**Q20. (IBPS PO 2021)** A man purchases 10 pens for ₹15 and sells 15 pens for ₹10. What is his loss percentage?

**Method (LCM approach):**
- LCM of 10 and 15 = 30 pens
- CP of 30 pens = (30/10) × 15 = ₹45
- SP of 30 pens = (30/15) × 10 = ₹20
- Loss = 25 on CP of 45
- Loss% = (25/45) × 100 = 55.56%
- **Answer: 55.56% loss** ⏱️ 35 seconds

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES & TRAPS

### **FREQUENT ERRORS STUDENTS MAKE**

**Mistake 1: Confusing MP with CP**
- MP is the labeled price (not what seller paid)
- Discount is always on MP, not CP
- Profit/Loss is always calculated on CP

**Mistake 2: Adding Successive Discounts Directly**
- 20% + 10% ≠ 30%
- Must use formula or multiplication method

**Mistake 3: Wrong Denominator in Percentage**
- Profit% = Profit/CP × 100 (NOT on SP)
- Discount% = Discount/MP × 100 (NOT on SP)
- Always remember the base!

**Mistake 4: Same SP Trap**
- When two items sold at same SP with x% profit and x% loss
- Students think it's break-even
- Reality: Always a loss = (x/10)²%

**Mistake 5: False Weight Confusion**
- Formula is (1000 - false weight)/false weight
- NOT (1000 - false weight)/1000

**Mistake 6: Percentage Increase-Decrease**
- If price increases 20% then decreases 20%
- Final price is NOT same as original
- Always results in net decrease = x²/100

### **TRICK QUESTIONS COMMONLY ASKED**

**Trap 1:** "A man claims to sell at cost price but uses 800g weight instead of 1kg. Find profit%"
- Students forget: Selling at CP doesn't mean no profit when using false weight!
- Answer: (200/800) × 100 = 25% profit

**Trap 2:** "MP is 25% above CP. To have no profit no loss, what discount to give?"
- Students give 25% (wrong!)
- Correct: 25/(100+25) × 100 = 20%

**Trap 3:** "Two articles sold at ₹1000 each, one at 10% profit, other at 10% loss"
- Students think break-even (wrong!)
- Correct: 1% loss always

**Trap 4:** "If CP of 15 items = SP of 12 items"
- Students calculate (15-12)/15 = 20% (wrong denominator!)
- Correct: Profit% = (3/12) × 100 = 25%

**Trap 5:** "Successive discounts of 40%, 20%, 10%"
- Students add: 70% (wrong!)
- Correct: 0.6 × 0.8 × 0.9 = 0.432 → 56.8% discount

### **HOW TO AVOID CALCULATION MISTAKES**

**1. Write CP, SP, MP clearly**
- Label what you're finding
- Don't mix up values

**2. Use assumed values (100 or 1000)**
- Makes calculation easier
- Reduces errors

**3. Check if answer makes sense**
- 200% profit on groceries? Unlikely!
- Helps catch errors

**4. Use approximations in MCQs**
- Don't waste time on exact decimals if options are far apart

**5. Practice mental math for common fractions**
- 1/4 = 25%, 1/3 = 33.33%, 2/3 = 66.67%
- Memorize these

### **TIPS FOR SPEED AND ACCURACY**

**Speed Tips:**

1. **Memorize These Forever:**
   - 10% = 1/10, 20% = 1/5, 25% = 1/4, 50% = 1/2
   - Use fractions instead of percentages for faster calculation

2. **Assume CP = 100 or 1000**
   - Eliminates decimal calculations
   - Easier to see profit/loss

3. **Use Ratio Method**
   - Faster than formula for simple problems
   - CP : SP ratios are quick

4. **Recognize Problem Patterns**
   - Same SP → use (x/10)² formula
   - False weight → direct formula
   - Successive discount → multiplication

5. **Skip Long Calculations**
   - In MCQs, eliminate obvious wrong answers first
   - Work backwards from options sometimes

**Accuracy Tips:**

1. **Read Question Twice**
   - Is it asking profit% or profit amount?
   - Is it MP or CP?

2. **Write Down Given Information**
   - Prevents mixing up values
   - 5 seconds investment saves errors

3. **Check Units**
   - All in rupees or all in paise?
   - Convert if needed

4. **Verify Your Answer**
   - Does it match the context?
   - Use reverse calculation if time permits

5. **Don't Round Off Too Early**
   - Round only in final answer
   - Keep at least 2 decimals during calculation

### **QUICK REVISION CHECKLIST (Before Exam)**

**30 Minutes Before Exam:**

✅ **Core Formulas (Write on rough paper):**
- Profit% = (Profit/CP) × 100
- SP = CP × (100 ± P%)/100
- Successive discount = D₁ + D₂ - (D₁D₂/100)
- Same SP loss = (x/10)²
- False weight profit% = (1000-x)/x × 100

✅ **Remember These Traps:**
- Two items at same SP with equal profit% and loss% → always loss
- Percentage increase then same % decrease → net decrease
- Discount is on MP, Profit is on CP

✅ **Quick Mental Check:**
- 33⅓% = 1/3
- 66⅔% = 2/3
- 12.5% = 1/8
- 16.67% = 1/6

✅ **Problem-Solving Priority:**
1. First identify: What's asked? (%, amount, CP, SP)
2. What's given? (List them)
3. Which formula/shortcut applies?
4. Assume values if percentages given
5. Calculate and verify

✅ **Time Management:**
- Basic problems: 30-40 seconds
- Intermediate: 45-60 seconds
- Advanced: 60-90 seconds
- If stuck beyond 60 seconds, mark for review

✅ **Common Question Types (Be Ready):**
- Same SP different profit/loss
- Successive discounts
- MP-Discount-Profit combined
- False weights
- If he had sold at X instead of Y
