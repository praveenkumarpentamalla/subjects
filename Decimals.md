# MASTERING DECIMALS FOR COMPETITIVE GOVERNMENT EXAMS

## 1. FOUNDATION TO ADVANCED COVERAGE

### **BASIC CONCEPTS & DEFINITIONS**

**What is a Decimal?**
A decimal is a way to represent fractions using a decimal point. The digits to the right of the decimal point represent parts of a whole.

**Place Value System:**
```
Units . Tenths Hundredths Thousandths Ten-thousandths
  5   .   7        3           8              2
```
- 5.7382 = 5 + 7/10 + 3/100 + 8/1000 + 2/10000

**Real-world example:** ₹45.75 means 45 rupees and 75 paise (75/100 of a rupee)

**Types of Decimals:**

1. **Terminating Decimals:** End after a finite number of digits
   - Example: 0.5, 0.25, 0.125

2. **Non-Terminating Repeating Decimals:** Digits repeat endlessly
   - Example: 0.333... (1/3), 0.142857142857... (1/7)

3. **Non-Terminating Non-Repeating:** Never end, never repeat
   - Example: π = 3.14159... (not covered in competitive exams)

**Decimal to Fraction Conversion:**
- 0.5 = 5/10 = 1/2
- 0.25 = 25/100 = 1/4
- 0.75 = 75/100 = 3/4
- 0.125 = 125/1000 = 1/8

**Fraction to Decimal Conversion:**
Divide numerator by denominator
- 1/4 = 1 ÷ 4 = 0.25
- 3/8 = 3 ÷ 8 = 0.375

### **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TECHNIQUES**

**Comparing Decimals:**
- Make the number of decimal places equal
- Compare: 0.5 vs 0.45
- Write as: 0.50 vs 0.45
- 0.50 > 0.45

**Ordering Decimals:**
Arrange from smallest to largest or vice versa
- 0.8, 0.75, 0.805, 0.9
- Standardize: 0.800, 0.750, 0.805, 0.900
- Order: 0.75 < 0.8 < 0.805 < 0.9

**Operations with Decimals:**

1. **Addition/Subtraction:**
   - Align decimal points
   - Add/subtract normally
   ```
     45.67
   + 12.30
   -------
     57.97
   ```

2. **Multiplication:**
   - Multiply ignoring decimals
   - Count total decimal places
   - Place decimal in answer
   ```
   2.5 × 3.2 = 25 × 32 = 800
   Total decimal places = 1 + 1 = 2
   Answer = 8.00 = 8
   ```

3. **Division:**
   - Make divisor a whole number
   - Adjust dividend accordingly
   - Divide normally
   ```
   12.5 ÷ 2.5 = 125 ÷ 25 = 5
   ```

### **ADVANCED PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES**

**Recurring Decimals:**

Converting recurring decimals to fractions:
- Pure recurring: 0.777... = 7/9
- Mixed recurring: 0.1666... = 1/6
- Complex recurring: 0.142857142857... = 1/7

**Formula Method for Recurring Decimals:**

For 0.ababab... (pure recurring with 2 digits):
= ab/99

For 0.abcabc... (pure recurring with 3 digits):
= abc/999

For 0.a̅b̅c̅ (bar over abc means recurring):
= abc/999

**Decimal in Algebraic Expressions:**
Problems involving decimals in equations, word problems, and comparisons.

**Special Patterns:**
- Powers of 10: Shifting decimal point
- Scientific notation representation
- Percentage-decimal conversion

## 2. ALL IMPORTANT FORMULAS & SHORTCUTS

### **BASIC FORMULAS**

**1. Decimal to Fraction:**
```
Decimal = Numerator/Denominator
Count decimal places = number of zeros in denominator
```
Example: 0.35 = 35/100 = 7/20 (2 decimal places = 100)

**2. Fraction to Decimal:**
```
Decimal = Numerator ÷ Denominator
```

**3. Pure Recurring Decimal to Fraction:**
```
0.ababab... = ab/99 (for 2-digit repeat)
0.abcabc... = abc/999 (for 3-digit repeat)
```

**4. Mixed Recurring Decimal:**
```
0.a(bc)̅ where bc repeats
= [abc - a]/(99 × 10^(non-recurring places))
```

Example: 0.1666... = 0.1(6)̅
= (16 - 1)/90 = 15/90 = 1/6

**5. Adding/Subtracting Decimals:**
```
Align decimal points → Add/Subtract
```

**6. Multiplying Decimals:**
```
Total decimal places in answer = Sum of decimal places in factors
```

**7. Dividing Decimals:**
```
Make divisor whole number by multiplying both by 10^n
```

- Recurring: 6
- Formula: (36 - 3)/90 = 33/90 = 11/30

**SHORTCUT 12: Decimal × Fraction**

Convert decimal to fraction, then multiply:
- 0.25 × 2/5 = (1/4) × (2/5) = 2/20 = 1/10 = 0.1

Or keep decimal and cross-multiply:
- 0.25 × 2/5 = (0.25 × 2)/5 = 0.5/5 = 0.1

- 1/6 = 0.1666... (remember **SIX** repeating after one place)

### **VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES**

**Number Line Visualization:**
```
0.0    0.25    0.5    0.75    1.0
├───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┤
0      1/4     1/2     3/4      1
```

**Decimal Place Value Grid:**
Imagine a grid where each column is 10 times smaller than the previous:
```
Hundreds | Tens | Units | . | Tenths | Hundredths | Thousandths
   100   |  10  |   1   | . |  0.1   |    0.01    |    0.001
```

**Pie Chart for Common Fractions:**
- Visualize 0.25 as 1/4 of a pizza
- 0.5 as half a pizza
- 0.75 as 3/4 of a pizza
- 0.333... as 1/3 of a pizza

**Recurring Decimal Pattern:**

- 4.5 × 11 = 49.5
- Works for single decimal digit numbers

### **MEMORY HOOKS THAT LAST LIFELONG**

**Hook 1: "Half and Quarter Money"**
Think of money:
- 50 paise = half rupee = 0.5 = 1/2
- 25 paise = quarter rupee = 0.25 = 1/4
- This connects decimals to real life permanently

**Hook 2: "The Cricket Score"**
Cricket scores use decimals for overs:
- 12.3 overs means 12 overs and 3 balls (out of 6)
- This is actually 12 + 3/6 = 12.5 overs in decimal
- Helps remember fraction-decimal conversion

**Hook 3: "The ATM Receipt"**
Your ATM balance shows decimals:
- ₹1,234.50 (you always read this correctly)
- Reinforces decimal place value understanding

**Hook 4: "The Pizza Slicing Rule"**
- Cut pizza in 2 = halves = 0.5 each
- Cut in 4 = quarters = 0.25 each
- Cut in 8 = eighths = 0.125 each
- Visual + tasty memory!

**Hook 5: "The Percentage Connection"**
- 25% = 25/100 = 0.25
- 75% = 75/100 = 0.75
- Always divide percentage by 100 to get decimal
- Think: "Percent means per hundred, decimal shows the hundred"

**Hook 6: "Recurring = Repeating Relationship"**
Think of a broken record that keeps playing the same part:
- 0.333... is like a stuck song playing "3-3-3-3..."
- The bar notation (0.3̅) is like a loop symbol in music

**Q20. (IBPS PO 2019)** If x = 1.5 and y = 2.5, find (x + y)(x - y) + 2xy

**Method:**
- This is (x² - y²) + 2xy = x² + 2xy - y² (but let's calculate directly)
- x + y = 4, x - y = -1
- (x + y)(x - y) = 4 × (-1) = -4
- 2xy = 2 × 1.5 × 2.5 = 2 × 3.75 = 7.5
- Total = -4 + 7.5 = 3.5

Or recognize: x² + 2xy - y² = (x + y)² - 2y² = 16 - 12.5 = 3.5
- **Answer: 3.5** ⏱️ 40 seconds

### **TIPS FOR SPEED AND ACCURACY**

**Speed Tips:**

**1. Memorize These Forever (Non-Negotiable):**
```
1/2 = 0.5          1/5 = 0.2          1/10 = 0.1
1/4 = 0.25         2/5 = 0.4          1/8 = 0.125
3/4 = 0.75         3/5 = 0.6          3/8 = 0.375
1/3 = 0.3̅          4/5 = 0.8          5/8 = 0.625
2/3 = 0.6̅          1/6 = 0.16̅         7/8 = 0.875
```

**2. Use Shortcut Multipliers:**
- ×0.5 = ÷2
- ×0.25 = ÷4
- ×0.125 = ÷8
- ×0.2 = ÷5

**3. Use Shortcut Divisors:**
- ÷0.5 = ×2
- ÷0.25 = ×4
- ÷0.2 = ×5

**4. Master Decimal Shifting:**
- Multiply/divide by 10, 100, 1000 = shift decimal
- Practice until automatic

**5. Recognize Common Squares:**
- (1.5)² = 2.25
- (2.5)² = 6.25
- (3.5)² = 12.25
- (4.5)² = 20.25
- Pattern: n.5² = n(n+1) + 0.25

**6. Use Fraction Form When Easier:**
- 0.25 × 80 → think (1/4) × 80 = 20

**7. Recurring Decimal Instant Recognition:**
- See 0.333...? → Think 1/3
- See 0.666...? → Think 2/3
- See 0.1666...? → Think 1/6

**Accuracy Tips:**

**1. The "Decimal Point Check":**
Before writing final answer, ask:
- Does this make logical sense?
- Is decimal in right place?

**2. The "Zero Count" Method:**
- In 0.001, count zeros: 3 zeros = thousandths
- Prevents 0.1 vs 0.01 vs 0.001 confusion

**3. Align Before Operating:**
Always write:
```
  3.45
+ 0.7
```
As:
```
  3.45
+ 0.70
------
```

**4. Use Estimation:**
- 6.8 × 4.2 ≈ 7 × 4 = 28
- Actual answer should be close to 28
- If you get 2.856, you know decimal is misplaced!

**5. The "Cross-Check" Method:**
- If you converted 3/8 = 0.375
- Quick check: 0.375 × 8 should give 3 ✓

**6. Practice Mental Rounding:**
- Round to nearest tenth/hundredth quickly
- Helps in MCQs where approximation works

**7. Write Intermediate Steps:**
- Don't do everything in head for complex problems
- One small error ruins entire answer

### **QUICK REVISION CHECKLIST (Before Exam)**

✅ **Shortcuts to Remember:**
- ×0.5 = ÷2
- ×0.25 = ÷4
- ÷0.5 = ×2
- ÷0.25 = ×4

✅ **Common Traps:**
- 0.9̅ = 1 (not 9/10)
- Comparing: Equalize decimal places first
- Division by small decimal gives LARGE answer
- Recurring uses 9 in denominator, not 10

✅ **Quick Mental Checks:**
- (n.5)² = n(n+1) + 0.25
- 1/9 = 0.1̅, 2/9 = 0.2̅, etc.
- Decimal × percentage = move point 2 left, then multiply

✅ **Time Management:**
- Basic conversion: 10-15 seconds
- Simple operation: 15-20 seconds
- Recurring decimal: 20-30 seconds
- Word problem: 40-60 seconds
- If stuck beyond 45 seconds, mark for review

✅ **Calculator-Free Tricks:**
- Use fractions when easier
- Simplify before multiplying
- Cancel common terms
- Estimate to verify

## FINAL POWER TIPS FOR EXAM DAY

🎯 **The 20-80 Rule:**
20% of decimal concepts give 80% of marks:
- Fraction-decimal conversion
- Basic operations
- Comparing decimals
- Recurring decimal to fraction

🎯 **The "Fraction First" Strategy:**
When you see decimals in problems, consider converting to fractions:
- 0.25 → 1/4 (easier to work with)
- 0.5 → 1/2 (simpler multiplication/division)

🎯 **The "Eliminate" Technique in MCQs:**
- If asked "Which is greatest: 0.7, 0.65, 0.699?"
- Eliminate: 0.65 is obviously smallest
- Now compare: 0.7 vs 0.699
- 0.700 vs 0.699 → 0.7 wins

🎯 **Mental Math Boosters:**
- 0.5 of anything = half
- 0.25 of anything = quarter
- 0.1 of anything = one-tenth
Use these instead of formal multiplication!

🎯 **Recurring Decimal Shorthand:**
In rough work, write:
- 0.3̅ as "1/3" (faster)
- 0.6̅ as "2/3" (clearer)

🎯 **Last-Minute Mantra:**
"Decimals are fractions in disguise. Point placement is precision. Recurring means repeating, denominator is 9s. When in doubt, convert and compute."

**Practice this systematically for 30 days, and decimals will become your strength!** 

Master the conversions, perfect the operations, memorize the shortcuts, and you'll breeze through decimal questions in competitive exams! 🎯📚

Good luck with your preparation! Remember: Consistent practice with these strategies will make decimal problems solve in under 30-45 seconds each! 💪
