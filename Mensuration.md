# MENSURATION: Complete Mastery Guide for Government Exams

## 1. FOUNDATION TO ADVANCED COVERAGE

### **BASIC CONCEPTS (Foundation Level)**

#### **A. What is Mensuration?**

**Definition:** Mensuration is the branch of mathematics that deals with the measurement of **length, area, volume, and surface area** of geometric figures.

**Real-world Applications:**
- **Perimeter:** Fencing a garden
- **Area:** Painting walls, carpeting floors
- **Volume:** Filling a water tank
- **Surface Area:** Wrapping a gift box

---

### **2D SHAPES (PLANE FIGURES)**

#### **1. SQUARE**

**Definition:** All 4 sides equal, all angles 90°

**Key Formulas:**
```
Perimeter = 4 × side = 4a
Area = side² = a²
Diagonal = side × √2 = a√2
```

**Real Example:** A square park with side 50m
- Perimeter (fencing) = 4 × 50 = 200m
- Area (grass) = 50² = 2500 m²

**Quick Pattern:**
- If area = 64 m² → side = 8m → perimeter = 32m
- If diagonal = 10√2 → side = 10 → area = 100

---

#### **2. RECTANGLE**

**Definition:** Opposite sides equal, all angles 90°

**Key Formulas:**
```
Perimeter = 2(length + breadth) = 2(l + b)
Area = length × breadth = l × b
Diagonal = √(l² + b²)
```

**Real Example:** Room 6m × 4m
- Perimeter (skirting) = 2(6+4) = 20m
- Area (flooring) = 6 × 4 = 24 m²
- Diagonal = √(36+16) = √52 ≈ 7.2m

**Common Pythagorean Triplets for Diagonals:**
- 3×4 rectangle → diagonal 5
- 5×12 rectangle → diagonal 13
- 8×15 rectangle → diagonal 17

---

#### **3. TRIANGLE**

**Basic Formula:**
```
Area = (1/2) × base × height
Perimeter = a + b + c (sum of all sides)
```

**Special Triangles:**

**a) Equilateral Triangle (all sides equal)**
```
Area = (√3/4) × side²
Height = (√3/2) × side
Perimeter = 3 × side
```

**b) Right Triangle**
```
Area = (1/2) × base × height
Hypotenuse² = base² + height² (Pythagoras)
```

**c) Isosceles Triangle (two sides equal)**
```
Area = (b/4)√(4a² - b²)
where a = equal sides, b = base
```

**d) Heron's Formula (when 3 sides known)**
```
s = (a + b + c)/2  [semi-perimeter]
Area = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]
```

---

#### **4. CIRCLE**

**Key Formulas:**
```
Circumference = 2πr = πd
Area = πr²
```

**Where:**
- r = radius
- d = diameter = 2r
- π ≈ 22/7 or 3.14

**Parts of Circle:**

**a) Sector** (pizza slice)
```
Arc length = (θ/360) × 2πr
Sector area = (θ/360) × πr²
```

**b) Segment** (area between chord and arc)
```
Segment area = Sector area - Triangle area
```

**Real Example:** Circular park, radius 14m
- Circumference (boundary) = 2 × (22/7) × 14 = 88m
- Area = (22/7) × 14² = 616 m²

---

#### **5. PARALLELOGRAM**

**Key Formulas:**
```
Area = base × height
Perimeter = 2(a + b)
```

**Note:** Height is perpendicular distance, not slant side!

---

#### **6. TRAPEZIUM**

**Key Formulas:**
```
Area = (1/2) × (sum of parallel sides) × height
     = (1/2) × (a + b) × h
```

**Real Example:** Field with parallel sides 20m and 30m, height 10m
- Area = (1/2) × (20+30) × 10 = 250 m²

---

#### **7. RHOMBUS**

**Key Formulas:**
```
Area = (1/2) × d₁ × d₂  [d₁, d₂ are diagonals]
Area = side² × sin(angle)
Perimeter = 4 × side
```

**Real Example:** Rhombus with diagonals 12cm and 16cm
- Area = (1/2) × 12 × 16 = 96 cm²

---

### **3D SHAPES (SOLID FIGURES)**

#### **1. CUBE**

**Definition:** All edges equal, all faces square

**Key Formulas:**
```
Volume = side³ = a³
Total Surface Area = 6 × side² = 6a²
Lateral Surface Area = 4 × side² = 4a²
Diagonal (space diagonal) = side × √3 = a√3
Face diagonal = side × √2 = a√2
```

**Real Example:** Dice with side 2cm
- Volume = 2³ = 8 cm³
- Surface Area = 6 × 4 = 24 cm²

---

#### **2. CUBOID (Rectangular Box)**

**Key Formulas:**
```
Volume = length × breadth × height = l × b × h
Total Surface Area = 2(lb + bh + lh)
Lateral Surface Area = 2h(l + b)
Diagonal = √(l² + b² + h²)
```

**Real Example:** Room 5m × 4m × 3m
- Volume = 5 × 4 × 3 = 60 m³
- Surface Area = 2(20 + 12 + 15) = 94 m²

---

#### **3. CYLINDER**

**Key Formulas:**
```
Volume = πr²h
Curved Surface Area = 2πrh
Total Surface Area = 2πr(h + r) = 2πrh + 2πr²
```

**Real Example:** Water tank, radius 7m, height 10m
- Volume = (22/7) × 49 × 10 = 1540 m³
- CSA = 2 × (22/7) × 7 × 10 = 440 m²

**Pattern Recognition:**
- If r = 7, h = 10 → Volume = 22 × 7 × 10 = 1540
- Mental shortcut with π = 22/7

---

#### **4. CONE**

**Key Formulas:**
```
Volume = (1/3)πr²h
Curved Surface Area = πrl  [l = slant height]
Total Surface Area = πr(l + r) = πrl + πr²
Slant height: l = √(r² + h²)
```

**Real Example:** Conical tent, radius 7m, height 24m
- Slant height = √(49 + 576) = √625 = 25m
- Volume = (1/3) × (22/7) × 49 × 24 = 1232 m³
- CSA = (22/7) × 7 × 25 = 550 m²

**Remember:** Cone volume is 1/3 of cylinder volume!

---

#### **5. SPHERE**

**Key Formulas:**
```
Volume = (4/3)πr³
Surface Area = 4πr²
```

**Hemisphere (half sphere):**
```
Volume = (2/3)πr³
Curved Surface Area = 2πr²
Total Surface Area = 3πr²
```

**Real Example:** Ball with radius 7cm
- Volume = (4/3) × (22/7) × 343 = 1437.33 cm³
- Surface Area = 4 × (22/7) × 49 = 616 cm²

---

### **INTERMEDIATE TECHNIQUES**

#### **A. Combination Problems**

**Type 1: Four Walls of a Room**
```
Area of 4 walls = 2h(l + b)
This is the Lateral Surface Area of cuboid!
```

**Example:** Room 5m × 4m × 3m, find painting cost
- Area of 4 walls = 2 × 3 × (5+4) = 54 m²
- If cost = ₹50/m² → Total = 54 × 50 = ₹2700

---

**Type 2: Path/Border Problems**

**Outside a rectangle:**
```
New length = l + 2w
New breadth = b + 2w
Path area = New area - Original area
```

**Inside a rectangle:**
```
New length = l - 2w
New breadth = b - 2w
Path area = Original area - New area
```

**Example:** Garden 50m × 30m, path 2m wide outside
- New dimensions: 54m × 34m
- Path area = (54×34) - (50×30) = 1836 - 1500 = 336 m²

**Quick Formula for Outside Path:**
```
Path area = 2w(l + b + 2w)
```

---

**Type 3: Melting/Recasting Problems**

**Golden Rule:**
```
Volume remains constant when melting/recasting
```

**Example:** 3 cubes of side 6cm melted to form one large cube
- Volume of 3 cubes = 3 × 6³ = 648 cm³
- Volume of large cube = 648
- Side³ = 648 → side = ∛648 ≈ 8.64cm

**Or recognize:** 648 = 216 × 3 = 6³ × 3

---

**Type 4: Water Tank/Cistern Problems**

**Volume = Area of base × Height**

**Example:** Rectangular cistern 6m × 4m, water 2m deep
- Volume of water = 6 × 4 × 2 = 48 m³ = 48,000 liters

**Conversion:** 1 m³ = 1000 liters

---

### **ADVANCED STRATEGIES**

#### **A. Maximum Area for Given Perimeter**

**Among all rectangles with same perimeter:**
- **Square has maximum area**

**Example:** Perimeter = 40m
- Rectangle 12×8: Area = 96 m²
- Square 10×10: Area = 100 m² ✓ (maximum)

---

#### **B. Minimum Perimeter for Given Area**

**Among all rectangles with same area:**
- **Square has minimum perimeter**

**Example:** Area = 100 m²
- Rectangle 20×5: Perimeter = 50m
- Square 10×10: Perimeter = 40m ✓ (minimum)

---

#### **C. Scaling Factor Problems**

**When dimensions change by factor k:**
```
Linear dimensions → × k
Area → × k²
Volume → × k³
```

**Example:** Radius of sphere doubled (k=2)
- New surface area = 4 times original
- New volume = 8 times original

---

### **TIME-SAVING SHORTCUTS**

#### **Shortcut 1: Quick π Calculations**

**When r = 7 or multiple of 7:**
Use π = 22/7 (cancels beautifully!)

**Example:** Circumference of circle, r = 14
```
C = 2 × (22/7) × 14 = 2 × 22 × 2 = 88
```

**When r is NOT multiple of 7:**
Use π ≈ 3.14 or leave as πr

---

#### **Shortcut 2: Diagonal Patterns**

**Square:** side × √2 ≈ side × 1.414
- side = 10 → diagonal ≈ 14.14

**Cube space diagonal:** side × √3 ≈ side × 1.732
- side = 10 → diagonal ≈ 17.32

**Rectangle:** Recognize Pythagorean triplets!
- 3×4 → diagonal 5
- 6×8 → diagonal 10
- 5×12 → diagonal 13

---

#### **Shortcut 3: Area of Equilateral Triangle**

**Instead of (√3/4)a²:**

**Approximate:** Area ≈ 0.433a²

**Example:** side = 10
- Area ≈ 0.433 × 100 = 43.3 cm²

**Or remember:** Area ≈ 43% of (side)²

---

#### **Shortcut 4: Volume Relationships**

```
Cone volume = (1/3) × Cylinder volume
(same base and height)

Sphere volume = (2/3) × Cylinder volume
(where cylinder height = diameter = 2r)
```

**Example:** Cylinder r=7, h=14
- Volume = 2156 cm³
- Sphere with same r: Volume = (2/3) × 2156 ≈ 1437 cm³

---

#### **Shortcut 5: Scaling Shortcut**

**Dimensions doubled:**
- Area becomes 4 times (2²)
- Volume becomes 8 times (2³)

**Dimensions tripled:**
- Area becomes 9 times (3²)
- Volume becomes 27 times (3³)

---

#### **Shortcut 6: Four Walls Formula**

**Instead of finding each wall separately:**
```
Area of 4 walls = 2h(l+b)
```

**Example:** Room 5m × 4m × 3m
- 4 walls = 2 × 3 × 9 = 54 m²

**One calculation instead of four!**

---

#### **Shortcut 7: Path Area (Outside)**

**Quick formula:**
```
Path area = 2w(l+b+2w)
```

**Example:** Garden 50×30, path 2m
- Path = 2×2(50+30+4) = 4×84 = 336 m²

---

#### **Shortcut 8: Circle to Square**

**Circle inscribed in square:**
```
Square side = 2r (diameter)
Circle area / Square area = π/4 ≈ 0.785
```

**Circle covers ~78.5% of square**

---

#### **Shortcut 9: Surface Area to Volume Ratio**

**For cube:**
```
SA/V = 6/side
```

**For sphere:**
```
SA/V = 3/r
```

**Smaller objects have higher SA/V ratio!**

---

#### **Shortcut 10: Quick Perimeter from Area**

**For square:**
- If area = 64 → side = 8 → perimeter = 32
- Pattern: P = 4√A

**For equilateral triangle:**
- If area = 16√3 → side = 8 → perimeter = 24

---

### **ALTERNATIVE METHODS**

**Problem:** Find area of triangle with sides 13, 14, 15

**Method 1: Heron's Formula (40s)**
```
s = (13+14+15)/2 = 21
