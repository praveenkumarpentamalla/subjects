# TIME AND WORK: Complete Mastery Guide for Government Exams

## 1. FOUNDATION TO ADVANCED COVERAGE

### **BASIC CONCEPTS (Foundation Level)**

**Core Definition:**
- **Work** = A task to be completed (always considered as 1 unit or 100%)
- **Time** = Days/hours needed to complete the work
- **Efficiency** = Work done per unit time

**Fundamental Principle:**
```
Work = Time × Efficiency
```

**Key Concept:** If A can do work in 10 days, then:
- A's 1 day work = 1/10
- A's efficiency = 10%

**Real-world Example:** If you can paint a room in 5 days working alone, you complete 1/5 (or 20%) of the room each day.

---

### **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TECHNIQUES**

#### **A. Multiple Workers**

**Concept:** When people work together, their efficiencies ADD UP.

**Example:** 
- A completes work in 12 days → A's 1 day work = 1/12
- B completes work in 15 days → B's 1 day work = 1/15
- Together: (1/12 + 1/15) per day = (5+4)/60 = 9/60 = 3/20 per day
- Time together = 20/3 = 6⅔ days

#### **B. Work and Wages**

**Principle:** Wages are distributed in the ratio of work done.

**Example:** A, B, C complete work in 6, 8, 12 days respectively.
- Efficiency ratio = 1/6 : 1/8 : 1/12 = 4:3:2
- If total wage = ₹1800, A gets = (4/9) × 1800 = ₹800

#### **C. Alternate Working Days**

**Pattern:** When workers alternate days, calculate work done in complete cycles.

---

### **ADVANCED PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES**

#### **A. Chain Work (Part by Part)**

When workers complete different portions of work:
- Calculate each person's contribution separately
- Add all contributions to equal 1 (complete work)

#### **B. Negative Work (Damage/Leakage)**

When someone undoes work (leakage in tank, error in work):
- Treat as negative efficiency
- Subtract from positive work

**Example:** Pipe A fills tank in 6 hours, Pipe B empties in 8 hours.
- Combined: 1/6 - 1/8 = (4-3)/24 = 1/24 per hour
- Together they fill in 24 hours

#### **C. Group Variations**

Men-Women-Children problems with different efficiencies:
- Always convert to one standard unit (usually "man-days")
- Use ratio of efficiencies

**Standard Ratios (commonly used):**
- 1 Man = 2 Women = 3 Children (typical assumption)

#### **D. Work Efficiency with Time Changes**

When working hours change daily:
- Calculate actual "work-hours"
- Efficiency per hour remains constant

---

## 2. FORMULAS & SHORTCUTS

### **MASTER FORMULA LIST**

#### **A. Basic Formulas**

1. **Work = Time × Efficiency**

2. **If A completes work in 'n' days:**
   - A's 1 day work = 1/n
   - A's efficiency = (100/n)%

3. **Combined Work (A and B together):**
   ```
   Time together = (A × B)/(A + B)
   ```
   Where A and B are individual days

4. **Three workers together:**
   ```
   Time = (A × B × C)/(AB + BC + CA)
   ```

5. **If A and B together complete in T days, and A alone in A days:**
   ```
   B's time = (A × T)/(A - T)
   ```

#### **B. Advanced Formulas**

6. **M₁D₁W₂ = M₂D₂W₁**
   - M = Number of men
   - D = Number of days
   - W = Work done
   
   Extended: **M₁D₁H₁/W₁ = M₂D₂H₂/W₂** (H = hours per day)

7. **Efficiency and Time (Inverse Relation):**
   ```
   E₁/E₂ = T₂/T₁
   ```

8. **Remaining Work Formula:**
   ```
   Remaining work = 1 - (days worked/total days needed)
   ```

9. **Work and Wages:**
   ```
   Wage ratio = Efficiency ratio = Time ratio (inverse)
   ```

10. **Alternate Day Work:**
    ```
    Work in 2 days by (A,B) = 1/A + 1/B
    Number of cycles = 1/(Work in 2 days)
    ```

---

### **TIME-SAVING SHORTCUTS**

#### **Shortcut 1: LCM Method (FASTEST for exam)**

**When to use:** Any combined work problem

**Method:**
1. Take LCM of all individual days = Total work
2. Calculate efficiency = Total work/Individual days
3. Combined efficiency = Sum of individual efficiencies
4. Time = Total work/Combined efficiency

**Example:** A=12 days, B=15 days, find combined time
- LCM(12,15) = 60 units (Total work)
- A's efficiency = 60/12 = 5 units/day
- B's efficiency = 60/15 = 4 units/day
- Together = 5+4 = 9 units/day
- Time = 60/9 = 6⅔ days

**Why it's best:** No fractions until the end!

---

#### **Shortcut 2: Direct Formula (Under 10 seconds)**

**For 2 workers:**
```
Time together = (Product)/(Sum) = (A×B)/(A+B)
```

**Example:** A=10 days, B=15 days
- Together = (10×15)/(10+15) = 150/25 = 6 days

---

#### **Shortcut 3: Percentage Method**

**When to use:** Problems with percentages or fractional work

**Method:**
- Total work = 100%
- Calculate daily efficiency as percentage
- Remaining work = 100% - work done%

**Example:** A does 20% per day, B does 25% per day
- Together = 45% per day
- Time = 100/45 = 2.22 days

---

#### **Shortcut 4: Ratio Method for Wages**

**Quick Ratio Conversion:**
If A takes 6 days, B takes 8 days, C takes 12 days:
- Time ratio = 6:8:12
- Efficiency ratio = 1/6:1/8:1/12 = **4:3:2** (multiply by LCM=24)
- Wage ratio = 4:3:2

---

#### **Shortcut 5: One-Third Rule**

If A, B, C can do work individually in a, b, c days:
```
Together time ≈ a/3 (when a≈b≈c)
```

---

### **ALTERNATIVE METHODS**

**Problem Type: A and B together in 12 days, A alone in 20 days, find B?**

**Method 1 (Traditional):**
- 1/20 + 1/B = 1/12
- 1/B = 1/12 - 1/20 = (5-3)/60 = 2/60 = 1/30
- B = 30 days

**Method 2 (Direct Formula):**
```
B = (A × T)/(A - T) = (20 × 12)/(20-12) = 240/8 = 30 days
```

**Method 3 (LCM - Fastest):**
- LCM(12,20) = 60
- Combined efficiency = 60/12 = 5
- A's efficiency = 60/20 = 3
- B's efficiency = 5-3 = 2
- B's time = 60/2 = 30 days

---

### **WHEN TO USE WHICH METHOD**

| Problem Type | Best Method | Time Taken |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 2-3 workers together | Product/Sum formula | 5-10 sec |
| Complex numbers | LCM Method | 15-30 sec |
| Percentage given | Percentage method | 10-15 sec |
| Wages distribution | Ratio method | 15-20 sec |
| Partial work done | LCM or Remaining work formula | 20-30 sec |
| Alternate days | Cycle method with LCM | 30-45 sec |

---

## 3. MEMORY TECHNIQUES

### **MNEMONICS FOR FORMULAS**

#### **A. "WET" - Work, Efficiency, Time**
```
W = E × T
```
Remember: Work makes you WET (Wet = Work-Efficiency-Time)

#### **B. "Products Over Sums" (POS)**
```
Combined time = Product/Sum
```
Memory hook: "POS-itive results come from POS formula"

#### **C. "MDHW" - The MDH Formula**
```
M₁D₁H₁/W₁ = M₂D₂H₂/W₂
```
Memory: "My Dear Happy Worker" = MDHW

#### **D. Inverse Twins**
```
Efficiency ∝ 1/Time
```
Memory: "E and T are inverse twins - when one grows, other shrinks"

#### **E. "1-Way Work"**
```
If A does in 'a' days, 1-day work = 1/a
```
Memory: "1-way to 1-day = 1/a"

---

### **VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES**

#### **A. The Tank Visualization**

Imagine work as filling a tank:
- A fills 1/10 per day = A adds 10% water daily
- B fills 1/15 per day = B adds 6.67% water daily
- Together = 16.67% daily
- Tank fills in ~6 days

**Visual:** Draw mental horizontal tank with percentage markers

#### **B. The Efficiency Bar Chart**

Create mental bar chart:
```
A: |||||||||| (10 units)
B: |||||||| (8 units)
C: |||||| (6 units)
Together: |||||||||||||||||||||||| (24 units)
```

#### **C. The Pizza Slice Method**

Think of work as a pizza:
- A eats whole pizza in 6 days = eats 1/6 daily
- B eats whole pizza in 8 days = eats 1/8 daily
- Together they finish faster!

---

### **PATTERN RECOGNITION TIPS**

#### **Pattern 1: Reciprocal Recognition**
When you see: "A finishes in 5 days"
Instantly think: "1/5 per day"

#### **Pattern 2: LCM Trigger Words**
Words like "together," "combined," "jointly" → Use LCM method

#### **Pattern 3: Ratio Red Flags**
Words like "wages," "share," "distribute" → Use efficiency ratios

#### **Pattern 4: The 3-6-9 Pattern**
- If time is 3, 6, 9, 12... → Efficiency will be clean numbers (LCM = smooth)

#### **Pattern 5: Inverse Relationship**
- Double efficiency → Half time
- Triple efficiency → One-third time

---

### **MEMORY HOOKS THAT LAST LIFELONG**

#### **Hook 1: "The Team-Up Formula"**
When two friends team up, time = (Friend1 × Friend2)/(Friend1 + Friend2)
> "When friends multiply their times and divide by sum, they finish faster!"

#### **Hook 2: "The Efficiency Paycheck"**
More efficient = Bigger paycheck
> Efficiency ratio = Wage ratio (always!)

#### **Hook 3: "The Opposite Time-Efficiency Rule"**
> "Time and Efficiency are enemies - they move opposite ways"

#### **Hook 4: "The Work = 1 Law"**
> "No matter how complex, total work is always 1"
> Use fractions that add to 1

#### **Hook 5: "The LCM Superpower"**
> "LCM kills fractions!" (Always use for clean calculation)

A can complete a work in 15 days and B can complete the same work in 20 days. They work together for 4 days, then A leaves. In how many more days will B complete the remaining work?

**Solution Method 1 (LCM - Fastest):**
- LCM(15, 20) = 60 units
- A's efficiency = 60/15 = 4 units/day
- B's efficiency = 60/20 = 3 units/day
- 4 days work = 4(4+3) = 28 units
- Remaining = 60-28 = 32 units
- B alone = 32/3 = 10⅔ days

**Solution Method 2 (Traditional):**
- Together 1 day = 1/15 + 1/20 = 7/60
- 4 days = 4×7/60 = 28/60 = 7/15
- Remaining = 1-7/15 = 8/15
- B's time = (8/15)/(1/20) = (8/15)×20 = 32/3 = 10⅔ days

**Q8. [SBI Clerk 2019]**
A, B and C can complete a work in 10, 12 and 15 days respectively. They started working together but A left 2 days before completion and B left 1 day before completion. In how many days was the work completed?

**Solution (Working Backwards):**
- LCM(10,12,15) = 60 units
- A=6, B=5, C=4 units/day
- Last day: Only C works = 4 units
- Second last day: B and C work = 5+4 = 9 units
- Remaining days: All three work = 6+5+4 = 15 units/day
- Total work done = 60 units
- Already done = 4+9 = 13 units
- Remaining = 60-13 = 47 units
- Days with all three = 47/15 = 3.13 days
- Total days = 3.13 + 1 + 1 = 5.13 days (approx 5 days)

Actually, let's recalculate:
- Let total days = x
- All work (x-2) days, B and C work 1 day, only C works 1 day
- 15(x-2) + 9(1) + 4(1) = 60
- 15x - 30 + 9 + 4 = 60
- 15x = 77
- x = 77/15 ≈ 5.13 days

**Answer:** Approximately 5 days

**Solution (Alternate Day Pattern):**
- LCM(30,40) = 120 units
- A = 4, B = 3 units/day
- 2-day cycle: A works day 1, B works both days
- Work in 2 days = 4 + 3 + 3 = 10 units
- Number of complete cycles = 120/10 = 12 cycles
- Total days = 12×2 = 24 days

**Answer:** 24 days

---

**Q11. [Railway Group D 2019]**
A pipe can fill a tank in 6 hours. Due to a leak in the bottom, it takes 9 hours to fill the tank. If the tank is full, how much time will the leak take to empty it?

**Solution (Negative Work):**
- Pipe fills: 1/6 per hour
- Pipe + Leak: 1/9 per hour
- Leak empties: 1/6 - 1/9 = (3-2)/18 = 1/18 per hour
- Leak empties full tank in 18 hours

**Answer:** 18 hours

---

**Q12. [SBI PO 2018]**
If 6 men and 8 boys can do a piece of work in 10 days while 26 men and 48 boys can do the same in 2 days, then the time taken by 15 men and 20 boys to do the same work will be?

**Solution (Equation Method):**
Let man = m units/day, boy = b units/day
- (6m + 8b)×10 = Total work
- (26m + 48b)×2 = Total work
- 60m + 80b = 52m + 96b
- 8m = 16b
- m = 2b (1 man = 2 boys)

Substituting in first equation:
- (6×2b + 8b)×10 = Total work
- 20b×10 = 200b = Total work

For 15 men and 20 boys:
- 15m + 20b = 15×2b + 20b = 50b per day
- Time = 200b/50b = 4 days

**Answer:** 4 days

### **ADVANCED LEVEL (Questions 13-20)**

---

**Q13. [SSC CGL 2021 - Tricky]**
A and B working together can complete a work in 12 days. B and C together can complete the same work in 16 days. C and A together can complete the same work in 24 days. In how many days can A alone complete the work?

**Solution (System of Equations):**
- A+B = 1/12 ... (1)
- B+C = 1/16 ... (2)
- C+A = 1/24 ... (3)

Add all three:
2(A+B+C) = 1/12 + 1/16 + 1/24
2(A+B+C) = (4+3+2)/48 = 9/48 = 3/16
A+B+C = 3/32

From (2): B+C = 1/16
A = (A+B+C) - (B+C) = 3/32 - 1/16 = 3/32 - 2/32 = 1/32

**Answer:** A alone can complete in 32 days

---

- Total days = 5×3 = 15 days

**Answer:** 15 days

---

**Q16. [Railway NTPC 2020 - M/W/C Problem]**
If 10 men or 18 women or 24 children can do a work in 20 days, then how many days will 5 men, 9 women and 12 children together take to complete the work?

**Solution (Standardization):**
- 10M = 18W = 24C (all can complete in 20 days)
- Converting to men: 1M = 1.8W = 2.4C
- Or: 1M = 1M, 1W = 10/18 M = 5/9 M, 1C = 10/24 M = 5/12 M

Standard work in man-days = 10M × 20 = 200 man-days

5M + 9W + 12C in terms of men:
= 5 + 9×(5/9) + 12×(5/12)
= 5 + 5 + 5 = 15 men equivalent

Time = 200/15 = 40/3 = 13⅓ days

**Answer:** 13⅓ days

---

**Q17. [SBI PO 2021 - Partial Work]**
A can complete ⅖ of a work in 10 days and B can complete ⅓ of the same work in 8 days. In how many days can both complete the work together?

**Solution:**
- A completes 2/5 in 10 days → Full work in 10×(5/2) = 25 days
- B completes 1/3 in 8 days → Full work in 8×3 = 24 days

A can do a work in 15 days. After working for 6 days, his efficiency decreases by 20%. In how many more days will he complete the remaining work?

**Solution:**
- Total work = 15 units (assume)
- Efficiency = 1 unit/day
- 6 days work = 6 units
- Remaining = 15-6 = 9 units
- New efficiency = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 units/day
- More days = 9/0.8 = 11.25 days

**Answer:** 11.25 days (or 11¼ days)

---

**Q19. [SSC CHSL 2020 - Three Phase Work]**
A started a work and worked for 4 days, then B joined and they worked together for 5 days, then C joined and all three completed the remaining work in 3 days. If A alone can do the work in 20 days and B alone in 30 days, in how many days can C alone do the work?

**Solution:**
- LCM(20,30) = 60 units
- A = 3, B = 2 units/day
- Phase 1 (4 days, only A): 3×4 = 12 units
- Phase 2 (5 days, A+B): (3+2)×5 = 25 units
- Phase 3 (3 days, A+B+C): Work done = 60-12-25 = 23 units
- (3+2+C)×3 = 23
- (5+C)×3 = 23
- 5+C = 23/3
- C = 23/3 - 5 = 23/3 - 15/3 = 8/3 units/day
- C alone = 60/(8/3) = 60×3/8 = 22.5 days

**Answer:** 22.5 days (or 22½ days)

---

**Q20. [Railway Group D 2022 - Master Level]**
A, B and C together can complete a task in 12 days. A and B together can do it in 20 days. C started working alone for 4 days, then A and B joined him. In how many days from the start will the entire work be completed?

**Solution:**
- A+B+C = 1/12
- A+B = 1/20
- C = 1/12 - 1/20 = (5-3)/60 = 2/60 = 1/30
- C works alone for 4 days: 4×(1/30) = 4/30 = 2/15
- Remaining = 1 - 2/15 = 13/15
- A+B complete remaining: (13/15)/(1/20) = (13/15)×20 = 260/15 = 17.33 days
- Total = 4 + 17.33 = 21.33 days

**Answer:** Approximately 21⅓ days

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES & TRAPS

### **FREQUENT ERRORS STUDENTS MAKE**

#### **Error 1: Forgetting to Find TOTAL Work First**

❌ **Wrong:** "A does 1/10 per day, works 3 days, so remaining = 1 - 3/10"
✅ **Correct:** First ensure what "1" represents (complete work)

**Trap Question:** "A completes 3/5 of work in 12 days. How many days for full work?"
- Trap: Thinking answer is 12 days
- Correct: 12 days for 3/5 → Full work = 12×(5/3) = 20 days

#### **Error 2: Adding Times Instead of Efficiencies**

❌ **Wrong:** "A = 10 days, B = 15 days → Together = 10+15 = 25 days"
✅ **Correct:** Add efficiencies (1/10 + 1/15), not times!

**Remember:** Times ADD only when people work SEPARATELY, not together!

#### **Error 3: Wrong Inverse Relationship**

❌ **Wrong:** "A is 50% more efficient → takes 50% more time"
✅ **Correct:** 50% more efficiency → takes 2/3 time (inverse!)

**Pattern:**
- 100% more efficiency (double) → Half time
- 50% more efficiency (3/2
