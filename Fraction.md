# FRACTIONS: Complete Mastery Guide for Government Exams

## 1. FOUNDATION TO ADVANCED COVERAGE

### **BASIC CONCEPTS (Foundation Level)**

#### **A. What is a Fraction?**

**Definition:** A fraction represents a part of a whole. It has two components:

```
Numerator
─────────  ← Fraction bar (division)
Denominator
```

**Example:** 3/4
- **Numerator (3):** Number of parts we have
- **Denominator (4):** Total number of equal parts

**Real-world Example:** 
- Pizza cut into 4 slices, you eat 3 → 3/4 of pizza
- ₹3 out of ₹4 → 3/4 of the money

---

#### **B. Types of Fractions**

**1. Proper Fraction:** Numerator < Denominator
```
Examples: 2/3, 5/7, 11/13
Value: Always less than 1
```

**2. Improper Fraction:** Numerator ≥ Denominator
```
Examples: 7/3, 9/5, 11/11
Value: Greater than or equal to 1
```

**3. Mixed Fraction:** Whole number + Proper fraction
```
Examples: 2¼, 3⅔, 5⅘
Represents: 2 + 1/4, 3 + 2/3, 5 + 4/5
```

**4. Unit Fraction:** Numerator = 1
```
Examples: 1/2, 1/5, 1/100
Special property: Used in many competitive problems
```

**5. Like Fractions:** Same denominator
```
Examples: 2/7, 3/7, 5/7
Easy to add/subtract!
```

**6. Unlike Fractions:** Different denominators
```
Examples: 1/2, 2/3, 3/4
Need LCM for operations
```

**7. Equivalent Fractions:** Same value, different appearance
```
Examples: 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 50/100
Multiply/divide both numerator and denominator by same number
```

---

#### **C. Converting Between Types**

**Improper to Mixed:**
```
Step 1: Divide numerator by denominator
Step 2: Quotient = Whole number
Step 3: Remainder = New numerator
Step 4: Denominator stays same
```

**Example:** 17/5
```
17 ÷ 5 = 3 remainder 2
17/5 = 3⅖
```

**Mixed to Improper:**
```
Formula: (Whole × Denominator + Numerator) / Denominator
```

**Example:** 3⅖
```
= (3×5 + 2)/5 = 17/5
```

**Memory Hook:** "Multiply whole by bottom, add top, keep bottom!"

---

### **FUNDAMENTAL OPERATIONS**

#### **1. ADDITION OF FRACTIONS**

**A. Like Fractions (Same Denominator)**
```
Add numerators, keep denominator same
a/c + b/c = (a+b)/c
```

**Example:** 2/7 + 3/7 = 5/7

---

**B. Unlike Fractions (Different Denominators)**

**Method 1: LCM Method (Most Common)**

**Steps:**
1. Find LCM of denominators
2. Convert each fraction to equivalent fraction with LCM as denominator
3. Add numerators

**Example:** 1/2 + 1/3
```
LCM(2,3) = 6
1/2 = 3/6
1/3 = 2/6
Sum = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6
```

---

**Method 2: Cross-Multiplication Method (Quick for 2 fractions)**

```
a/b + c/d = (ad + bc) / bd
```

**Example:** 1/2 + 1/3
```
= (1×3 + 1×2) / (2×3)
= (3 + 2) / 6
= 5/6
```

**When to use:** Fast for 2 fractions with small numbers

---

#### **2. SUBTRACTION OF FRACTIONS**

**Same rules as addition!**

**Unlike fractions:**
```
a/b - c/d = (ad - bc) / bd
```

**Example:** 3/4 - 1/3
```
= (3×3 - 4×1) / (4×3)
= (9 - 4) / 12
= 5/12
```

---

#### **3. MULTIPLICATION OF FRACTIONS**

**Simple Rule:** Multiply numerators, multiply denominators

```
a/b × c/d = (a×c) / (b×d)
```

**Example:** 2/3 × 4/5 = 8/15

**SHORTCUT: Cross-Cancellation (Before multiplying)**

**Example:** 2/3 × 9/4
```
Cancel 2 and 4: 1/3 × 9/2
Cancel 9 and 3: 1/1 × 3/2 = 3/2
```

**Saves calculation time!**

---

**Multiplying Mixed Fractions:**
**Convert to improper first!**

**Example:** 2½ × 1⅓
```
= 5/2 × 4/3
= 20/6 = 10/3 = 3⅓
```

---

#### **4. DIVISION OF FRACTIONS**

**Golden Rule:** Multiply by the reciprocal (flip the second fraction)

```
a/b ÷ c/d = a/b × d/c = (a×d) / (b×c)
```

**Example:** 2/3 ÷ 4/5
```
= 2/3 × 5/4
= 10/12 = 5/6
```

**Memory Hook:** "Division? Flip and multiply!"

---

### **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TECHNIQUES**

#### **A. Comparing Fractions**

**Method 1: Cross-Multiplication (For 2 fractions)**

To compare a/b and c/d:
- Calculate a×d and b×c
- If a×d > b×c, then a/b > c/d

**Example:** Which is greater: 3/5 or 4/7?
```
3×7 = 21
5×4 = 20
21 > 20, so 3/5 > 4/7
```

---

**Method 2: Convert to Decimals**
```
3/5 = 0.6
4/7 ≈ 0.571
0.6 > 0.571
```

---

**Method 3: Make Denominators Same**
```
3/5 = 21/35
4/7 = 20/35
21/35 > 20/35
```

---

**Method 4: Quick Visualization (When close to 1)**

**Example:** Compare 99/100 and 199/200
- Both close to 1
- 99/100 is 1/100 short of 1
- 199/200 is 1/200 short of 1
- 1/200 < 1/100 (smaller shortfall)
- So 199/200 > 99/100

---

#### **B. Simplifying Fractions**

**Reduce to Lowest Terms:** Divide numerator and denominator by their HCF

**Example:** 24/36
```
HCF(24, 36) = 12
24/36 = 2/3
```

**Quick Recognition Patterns:**
- If both even → Divide by 2
- If both end in 0 or 5 → Divide by 5
- Use divisibility rules

---

#### **C. Fraction to Decimal Conversion**

**Method:** Divide numerator by denominator

**Common Conversions to Memorize:**
```
1/2 = 0.5
1/3 = 0.333... = 0.3̄
1/4 = 0.25
1/5 = 0.2
1/6 = 0.1666... = 0.16̄
1/7 = 0.142857... (repeating)
1/8 = 0.125
1/9 = 0.111... = 0.1̄
1/10 = 0.1
```

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Denominator 2, 5, 10 → Terminating decimal
- Denominator 3, 7, 9 → Repeating decimal

---

#### **D. Decimal to Fraction Conversion**

**Terminating Decimal:**

**Example:** 0.75
```
= 75/100
= 3/4 (simplified)
```

**General Rule:**
- Count decimal places
- Denominator = 10^(number of places)
- Simplify

**Example:** 0.625
```
= 625/1000
= 5/8
```

---

**Repeating Decimal:**

**Example:** 0.3̄ (0.333...)
```
Let x = 0.333...
10x = 3.333...
10x - x = 3
9x = 3
x = 3/9 = 1/3
```

---

### **ADVANCED PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES**

#### **A. Fractional Equations**

**Type 1: Find the Unknown**

**Example:** 2/3 of a number is 40. Find the number.
```
(2/3) × x = 40
x = 40 × (3/2)
x = 60
```

**Pattern:** To "undo" multiplication by fraction, multiply by its reciprocal

---

**Type 2: Part of Part**

**Example:** What is 2/5 of 3/4?
```
2/5 × 3/4 = 6/20 = 3/10
```

**Real-world:** 2/5 of the 3/4 completed work = 3/10 of total work

---

#### **B. Fraction Word Problems**

**Type 1: Inheritance/Distribution**

**Example:** A man leaves 1/3 of his property to his son, 1/4 to his daughter, and the rest to his wife. If the wife gets ₹25,000, what was the total property?

**Solution:**
```
Son's share = 1/3
Daughter's share = 1/4
Together = 1/3 + 1/4 = 7/12
Wife's share = 1 - 7/12 = 5/12

5/12 = 25,000
Total = 25,000 × (12/5) = ₹60,000
```

---

**Type 2: Consumed/Remaining**

**Example:** A tank is 3/4 full. After using 1/2 of its contents, what fraction remains?

**Solution:**
```
Initial = 3/4
Used = 1/2 of 3/4 = 3/8
Remaining = 3/4 - 3/8 = 3/8
```

---

**Type 3: Work Rate Problems**

**Example:** A can do work in 6 days, B in 8 days. Working together, in how many days?

**Solution:**
```
A's rate = 1/6 per day
B's rate = 1/8 per day
Combined = 1/6 + 1/8 = 7/24 per day
Time = 1 ÷ (7/24) = 24/7 = 3³/₇ days
```

---

#### **C. Complex Fractions**

**Definition:** Fraction within a fraction

**Example:** Simplify (2/3) / (4/5)
```
= 2/3 × 5/4
= 10/12 = 5/6
```

**Rule:** Treat as division!

---

#### **D. Continued Fractions**

**Pattern:** 1 + 1/(2 + 1/3)

**Solve from inside out:**
```
= 1 + 1/(7/3)
= 1 + 3/7
= 10/7
```

---

A man spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on food, and 1/5 on transport. If he saves ₹13,000, what is his salary?

**Solution:**
```
Spent = 1/4 + 1/3 + 1/5
LCM(4,3,5) = 60
= 15/60 + 20/60 + 12/60 = 47/60

Saved = 1 - 47/60 = 13/60

13/60 = 13,000
Salary = 13,000 × 60/13 = ₹60,000
```

**Answer:** ₹60,000
**Time:** 50 seconds

**Q15. [SSC CGL 2017]**
If 3/5 of a number exceeds its 2/7 by 76, find the number.

**Solution:**
```
3/5 × N - 2/7 × N = 76
N(3/5 - 2/7) = 76
N[(21-10)/35] = 76
N × 11/35 = 76
N = 76 × 35/11 = 241.82... 

Actually, let me recalculate:
N = 76 × 35/11 = 2660/11 ≈ 241.82

Hmm, should be cleaner. Let me check:
(3/5 - 2/7)N = 76
(21/35 - 10/35)N = 76
11N/35 = 76
N = 76 × 35/11 = 240 (if 76×35 = 2660, 2660/11... not clean)

Let me verify the question -
