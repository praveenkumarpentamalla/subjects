# PERCENTAGES: Complete Mastery Guide for Government Exams

## 1. FOUNDATION TO ADVANCED COVERAGE

### **BASIC CONCEPTS (Foundation Level)**

#### **A. What is a Percentage?**

**Definition:** Percentage means "per hundred" or "out of 100."

**Symbol:** % 

**Basic Idea:**
```
50% = 50 out of 100 = 50/100 = 1/2 = 0.5
```

**Real-world Examples:**
- **Discount:** 20% off on ₹500 → Save ₹100
- **Marks:** 75% in exam → 75 marks out of 100
- **Tax:** 18% GST on ₹1000 → Pay ₹180 extra
- **Interest:** 10% return on ₹10,000 → Earn ₹1,000

---

#### **B. Basic Conversions**

**1. Fraction to Percentage:**
```
Multiply by 100

Example: 3/4 = (3/4) × 100 = 75%
```

**2. Percentage to Fraction:**
```
Divide by 100

Example: 25% = 25/100 = 1/4
```

**3. Decimal to Percentage:**
```
Multiply by 100

Example: 0.65 = 0.65 × 100 = 65%
```

**4. Percentage to Decimal:**
```
Divide by 100

Example: 40% = 40/100 = 0.4
```

---

#### **C. Common Percentage-Fraction-Decimal Equivalents (MEMORIZE!)**

**Essential Values:**
```
50% = 1/2 = 0.5
25% = 1/4 = 0.25
75% = 3/4 = 0.75
33.33% = 1/3 = 0.333...
66.67% = 2/3 = 0.667...
20% = 1/5 = 0.2
40% = 2/5 = 0.4
60% = 3/5 = 0.6
80% = 4/5 = 0.8
10% = 1/10 = 0.1
12.5% = 1/8 = 0.125
16.67% = 1/6 = 0.1667
```

**Why memorize?** Instant conversion saves 10-15 seconds per problem!

---

#### **D. Finding Percentage of a Number**

**Formula:**
```
x% of N = (x/100) × N
```

**Example:** 30% of 500
```
= (30/100) × 500
= 0.3 × 500
= 150
```

**Shortcut:** "Of" means multiply!

---

#### **E. Finding What Percent One Number is of Another**

**Formula:**
```
(Part/Whole) × 100 = Percentage
```

**Example:** 40 is what % of 200?
```
= (40/200) × 100
= 0.2 × 100
= 20%
```

---

#### **F. Finding the Whole When Percentage is Known**

**Formula:**
```
Whole = (Part × 100) / Percentage
```

**Example:** 30% of what number is 60?
```
Whole = (60 × 100) / 30 = 200
```

---

### **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TECHNIQUES**

#### **A. Percentage Increase/Decrease**

**Percentage Increase:**
```
% Increase = [(New Value - Original) / Original] × 100
```

**Example:** Price increases from ₹500 to ₹600
```
% Increase = [(600-500)/500] × 100 = (100/500) × 100 = 20%
```

---

**Percentage Decrease:**
```
% Decrease = [(Original - New Value) / Original] × 100
```

**Example:** Price decreases from ₹800 to ₹640
```
% Decrease = [(800-640)/800] × 100 = (160/800) × 100 = 20%
```

---

**Finding New Value After % Change:**

**Increase:**
```
New Value = Original × (1 + %Increase/100)
```

**Example:** Increase ₹500 by 20%
```
= 500 × (1 + 20/100)
= 500 × 1.2
= ₹600
```

**Decrease:**
```
New Value = Original × (1 - %Decrease/100)
```

**Example:** Decrease ₹800 by 20%
```
= 800 × (1 - 20/100)
= 800 × 0.8
= ₹640
```

---

#### **B. Successive Percentage Changes**

**Key Concept:** Two successive changes are NOT simply added!

**Formula for Two Changes:**
```
Net % = a + b + (ab/100)

where a and b are % changes (use - for decrease)
```

**Example:** Price increases 10%, then increases 20%
```
Net % = 10 + 20 + (10×20/100)
      = 30 + 2
      = 32%
```

**NOT 30%!**

---

**Example with Decrease:** Increase 20%, then decrease 10%
```
Net % = 20 + (-10) + (20×(-10)/100)
      = 20 - 10 - 2
      = 8% increase
```

---

**Alternative Method (Multipliers):**
```
New Value = Original × (1+a/100) × (1+b/100)
```

**Example:** ₹1000, +10% then +20%
```
= 1000 × 1.1 × 1.2
= 1000 × 1.32
= ₹1320 (32% increase)
```

---

#### **C. Percentage Points vs Percentage Change**

**CRITICAL DIFFERENCE:**

**Percentage Points:** Absolute difference
**Percentage Change:** Relative difference

**Example:** Rate changes from 20% to 25%

**Percentage Point Increase:** 25 - 20 = **5 percentage points**

**Percentage Increase:** 
```
= [(25-20)/20] × 100 = 25%
```

**Two different concepts!**

---

#### **D. Expressing One Quantity as % of Another**

**When comparing two quantities:**

**Example:** A = 80, B = 120

**A is what % of B?**
```
= (80/120) × 100 = 66.67%
```

**B is what % more than A?**
```
= [(120-80)/80] × 100 = 50% more
```

**A is what % less than B?**
```
= [(120-80)/120] × 100 = 33.33% less
```

**Note:** "More than" uses smaller as base, "less than" uses larger as base!

---

### **ADVANCED PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES**

#### **A. Percentage Change Reversal**

**Key Insight:** If something increases by x%, what % decrease brings it back?

**Formula:**
```
Required Decrease = [x/(100+x)] × 100
```

**Example:** Price increased 25%. What % decrease to restore?
```
= [25/(100+25)] × 100
= (25/125) × 100
= 20%
```

**Similarly, if decreased by x%:**
```
Required Increase = [x/(100-x)] × 100
```

**Example:** Price decreased 20%. What % increase to restore?
```
= [20/(100-20)] × 100
= (20/80) × 100
= 25%
```

**Pattern:** Restoring is NOT the same %!

---

#### **B. Population/Production Problems**

**Standard pattern:**
```
Final = Initial × (1 ± r/100)^n

+ for increase
- for decrease
n = number of periods
```

**Example:** Population 50,000, grows 10% annually for 2 years
```
= 50000 × (1.1)²
= 50000 × 1.21
= 60,500
```

---

#### **C. Profit/Loss as Percentage**

**Formulas:**
```
Profit % = (Profit/Cost Price) × 100
Loss % = (Loss/Cost Price) × 100

Selling Price = CP + Profit = CP - Loss
```

**Example:** Bought for ₹500, sold for ₹600
```
Profit = 600 - 500 = ₹100
Profit % = (100/500) × 100 = 20%
```

---

**Finding SP from CP and Profit%:**
```
SP = CP × (1 + Profit%/100)
```

**Finding CP from SP and Profit%:**
```
CP = SP / (1 + Profit%/100)
```

---

#### **D. Percentage in Elections/Voting**

**Common structure:**
- Candidate A gets x%
- Candidate B gets remaining
- Margin of victory

**Example:** A gets 60%, B gets 40%, total 10,000 votes
```
A's votes = 60% of 10000 = 6000
B's votes = 40% of 10000 = 4000
Margin = 6000 - 4000 = 2000 votes
```

---

#### **E. Mixture and Alligation (Using Percentages)**

**When mixing two solutions:**

**Rule of Alligation:**
```
Ratio = (Higher % - Mean %) : (Mean % - Lower %)
```

**Example:** Mix 20% and 40% solutions to get 25%
```
Ratio = (40-25) : (25-20)
      = 15 : 5
      = 3 : 1
```

---

#### **F. Percentage in Time-Speed-Distance**

**Speed increase/decrease:**

**If speed increases by x%, time decreases by:**
```
[x/(100+x)] × 100%
```

**If speed decreases by x%, time increases by:**
```
[x/(100-x)] × 100%
```

**Example:** Speed increased 20%, time change?
```
Decrease = [20/120] × 100 = 16.67% decrease
```

---

## 2. FORMULAS & SHORTCUTS

### **MASTER FORMULA LIST**

#### **A. Basic Formulas**

**1. Percentage to Fraction:**
```
x% = x/100
```

**2. Finding x% of N:**
```
(x/100) × N
```

**3. A is what % of B:**
```
(A/B) × 100
```

**4. What number's x% is N:**
```
(N × 100) / x
```

---

#### **B. Increase/Decrease**

**5. Percentage Increase:**
```
[(New - Old) / Old] × 100
```

**6. Percentage Decrease:**
```
[(Old - New) / Old] × 100
```

**7. Value after Increase:**
```
Old × (1 + x/100)
```

**8. Value after Decrease:**
```
Old × (1 - x/100)
```

---

#### **C. Successive Changes**

**9. Two Successive % Changes:**
```
Net % = a + b + (ab/100)
```

**10. Three Successive Changes:**
```
Net = Original × (1+a/100)(1+b/100)(1+c/100)
```

---

#### **D. Special Cases**

**11. Restoring after Increase:**
```
Decrease needed = [x/(100+x)] × 100
```

**12. Restoring after Decrease:**
```
Increase needed = [x/(100-x)] × 100
```

**13. A is x% more than B:**
```
A = B(1 + x/100)
B = A/(1 + x/100)
```

**14. A is x% less than B:**
```
A = B(1 - x/100)
B = A/(1 - x/100)
```

---

### **TIME-SAVING SHORTCUTS**

#### **Shortcut 1: Finding 10%, 5%, 1%**

**10% = Move decimal one place left**
```
10% of 450 = 45
```

**5% = Half of 10%**
```
5% of 450 = 22.5
```

**1% = Move decimal two places left**
```
1% of 450 = 4.5
```

**Build other percentages:**
```
15% = 10% + 5% = 45 + 22.5 = 67.5
```

---

#### **Shortcut 2: Common Percentage Values (Memorize!)**

```
12.5% = 1/8 → Divide by 8
25% = 1/4 → Divide by 4
33.33% = 1/3 → Divide by 3
50% = 1/2 → Divide by 2
75% = 3/4 → Three-fourths
```

**Example:** 25% of 80
```
= 1/4 of 80 = 20
```

**Faster than (25/100) × 80!**

---

#### **Shortcut 3: Successive % Changes (Quick)**

**For small numbers:**

**Example:** +10% then +20%
```
Step 1: Original = 100 (assume)
Step 2: After +10% = 110
Step 3: After +20% on 110 = 110 × 1.2 = 132
Net change = 32%
```

**Or use formula:** 10 + 20 + (10×20/100) = 32%

---

#### **Shortcut 4: Finding % Increase/Decrease**

**Quick mental pattern:**

**Increase from 50 to 60:**
```
Increase = 10, Base = 50
% = 10/50 = 1/5 = 20%
```

**Look for simple fractions!**

---

#### **Shortcut 5: Percentage More/Less**

**A is 25% more than B = 100**

**Quick:** A = 125

**B is what % less than A?**
```
Instead of calculation:
Difference = 25, New base = 125
25/125 = 1/5 = 20%
```

**Pattern:** More/less are NOT reciprocals!

---

#### **Shortcut 6: Reversal Percentages (Key Patterns)**

**Memorize these:**
```
+25% → -20% to restore
+20% → -16.67% to restore
+50% → -33.33% to restore
+100% → -50% to restore

-20% → +25% to restore
-25% → +33.33% to restore
-50% → +100% to restore
```

---

#### **Shortcut 7: Election Margin**

**If A gets x% and B gets (100-x)%:**
```
Margin = Total × (2x - 100)/100
```

**Example:** A gets 60%, Total = 5000
```
Margin = 5000 × (120-100)/100 = 5000 × 0.2 = 1000
```

---

#### **Shortcut 8: Percentage from Ratio**

**If ratio A:B = 3:5**

**A's percentage:**
```
= [3/(3+5)] × 100 = (3/8) × 100 = 37.5%
```

**B's percentage:**
```
= (5/8) × 100 = 62.5%
```

---

#### **Shortcut 9: Quick Calculation for 15%, 35%, etc.**

**15% = 10% + 5%**
**35% = 10% × 3 + 5%**
**45% = 50% - 5%**

**Example:** 15% of 200
```
10% = 20
5% = 10
Total = 30
```

---

#### **Shortcut 10: Percentage Change in Products**

**If both dimensions change:**

**Length +20%, Width -10%**
```
Area change = 20 + (-10) + (20×(-10)/100)
            = 20 - 10 - 2
            = 8% increase
```

---

### **WHEN TO USE WHICH METHOD**

| Problem Type | Best Method | Time Saved |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| x% of simple number | Use fraction equivalent | 10s |
| Successive changes (2) | Formula a+b+ab/100 | 15s |

## 3. MEMORY TECHNIQUES

### **MNEMONICS FOR FORMULAS**

#### **A. "PON" (Percentage of Number)**

```
P% O N = (P/100) × N
```

**Memory:** "**P**ercentage **O**f **N**umber = PON multiply!"

---

#### **B. "PAWN" (Part As Whole's Number)**

```
% = (Part/Whole) × 100
```

**Memory:** "**P**art **A**s **W**hole's **N**umber percent"

---

#### **C. "A-Plus-B-Plus-AB" (Successive Changes)**

```
Net % = a + b + (ab/100)
```

**Chant:** "A plus B plus A-B-by-hundred!"

---

#### **D. "New Minus Old Over Old" (% Change)**

```
% Change = [(New - Old) / Old] × 100
```

**Memory:** "New **M**inus **O**ld **O**ver **O**ld = NOOO!"

---

#### **E. "X Over Hundred-Plus-X" (Restoration)**

```
After increase: x/(100+x) × 100
```

**Memory:** "X over hundred-PLUS-X when going back from increase"

---

### **VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES**

#### **A. The 100-Box Grid**

**Visualize percentage as shaded squares in 10×10 grid:**

```
25% = 1/4 of grid shaded
50% = Half grid shaded
75% = 3/4 grid shaded
```

**Helps understand "per hundred"**

---

#### **B. The Pie Chart**

**For percentages adding to 100%:**

```
    60%
  _______
 /   |   \
|    |    |
 \ 40% /
  -----
```

**Visual distribution**

---

#### **C. The Number Line (Increase/Decrease)**

```
Old Value -----(+20%)-----> New Value
   100             120

New Value ----(-16.67%)---> Old Value
   120              100
```

**See the asymmetry!**

---

### **PATTERN RECOGNITION TIPS**

#### **Pattern 1: Complementary Percentages**

```
If A is 30%, B is 70% (sum to 100%)
If A is 1/3, B is 2/3
```

**Quick recognition in election/mixture problems**

---

#### **Pattern 2: Doubling/Halving**

```
100% increase = Doubling
50% decrease = Halving
200% increase = Tripling
```

---

#### **Pattern 3: Reciprocal Pattern**

```
If A is x% of B, then B is (100/x)% of A

Example:
If A is 25% of B, B is 400% of A
(Because 100/25 = 4 = 400%)
```

---

#### **Pattern 4: Successive Equal Changes**

```
Two +10% changes:
(1.1)² = 1.21 = 21% increase

Three +10% changes:
(1.1)³ = 1.331 = 33.1% increase
```

**Not 20% and 30%!**

---

#### **Pattern 5: Common Exam Percentages**

```
12.5%, 16.67%, 20%, 25%, 33.33%, 50%, 66.67%, 75%
```

**All relate to fractions with small denominators**

---

### **MEMORY HOOKS THAT LAST**

#### **Hook 1: "Per Cent = Per Hundred"**

> "Cent like century (100 years) - percentage is per 100!"

---

#### **Hook 2: "Successive is NOT Additive"**

> "Two 10% raises ≠ 20% raise - compound effect!"

---

#### **Hook 3: "Base Matters"**

> "30% more than 100 = 130, but 30% less than 130 ≠ 100!"

---

#### **Hook 4: "Fraction Friends"**

> "1/4 = 25%, 1/3 = 33.33%, 1/2 = 50% - friends forever!"

---

#### **Hook 5: "Increase is Easy, Restore is Harder"**

> "+25% increase needs -20% to restore - asymmetric!"

**Q13. [SSC CGL 2021]**
A man spends 75% of his income. If his income increases by 20% and expenditure increases by 10%, what is the percentage increase in his savings?

**Solution:**
```
Let income = 100
Savings = 25 (since expenditure = 75)

New income = 120
New expenditure = 75 × 1.1 = 82.5
New savings = 120 - 82.5 = 37.5

Increase in savings = 37.5 - 25 = 12.5
% increase = (12.5/25) × 100 = 50%
```

**Answer:** 50%
**Time:** 45 seconds

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES & TRAPS

### **FREQUENT ERRORS STUDENTS MAKE**

#### **Error 1: Adding Successive Percentages**

❌ **Wrong:** +10% then +20% = +30%

✅ **Correct:** 
```
Net = 10 + 20 + (10×20/100) = 32%
```

**Remember:** Compound effect!

---

#### **Error 2: Using Wrong Base**

❌ **Wrong:** "A is 50% of B" and "B is 50% of A"

✅ **Correct:**
- If A is 50% of B, then B is 200% of A
- Base matters!

---

#### **Error 3: Percentage vs Percentage Points**

❌ **Wrong:** "Interest increased from 10% to 15%" = "50% increase"

✅ **Correct:**
- Percentage point increase = 5 points
- Percentage increase = (5/10) × 100 = 50%
- Both are correct but different!

---

#### **Error 4: Restoration Formula Confusion**

❌ **Wrong:** +20% increase needs -20% to restore

✅ **Correct:** -16.67% needed

**Formula:** [20/120] × 100 = 16.67%

---

#### **Error 5: Wrong Calculation of % More/Less**

❌ **Wrong:** "A is 25% more than B" means "B is 25% less than A"

✅ **Correct:** B is 20% less than A

**Use proper base!**

---

#### **Error 6: Decimal/Fraction Confusion**

❌ **Wrong:** 1/3 = 30%

✅ **Correct:** 1/3 = 33.33%

---

#### **Error 7: Forgetting to Multiply by 100**

❌ **Wrong:** (25/100) = 0.25 = Answer

✅ **Correct:** When asked "what percent", multiply by 100!

---

### **TRICK QUESTIONS COMMONLY ASKED**

#### **Trick 1: The Zero Net Change**

**Question:** Price increased 25%, then decreased 20%. Net change?

**Trap:** Thinking -5% or +5%

**Correct:**
```
= 25 + (-20) + (25×(-20)/100)
= 5 - 5 = 0%
```

---

#### **Trick 2: The Passing Marks**

**Question:** A scores 30% and fails by 20 marks. B scores 50% and gets 40 marks more than passing. Passing marks?

**Trap:** Trying to find maximum marks first

**Direct:** 
```
20% = 60 marks (difference between 30% and 50%)
So 10% = 30 marks
Passing = 30% + 20 = 3(30) + 20 = 110 marks
```

---

#### **Trick 3: The Consumption Problem**

**Question:** Price increased 25%. Consumption reduced so expenditure unchanged. Reduction %?

**Trap:** Saying 25%

**Correct:** 20% (using restoration formula)

---

#### **Trick 4: The Election Margin**

**Question:** A beats B by 20% votes. What % of total did A get?

**Trap:** Saying 70% (100-20-10 logic)

**Correct:** 60%
```
If A = 60%, B = 40%
Margin = 60 - 40 = 20% ✓
```

---

#### **Trick 5: The Mixture Ratio Change**

**Question:** Ratio 2:3 becomes 3:4 after adding water. Original water?

**Trap:** Complex algebraic approach

**Better:** Assume convenient value and work backward

---

### **HOW TO AVOID CALCULATION MISTAKES**

#### **Strategy 1: Use Fractions When Possible**

**Instead of:**
```
(25/100) × 400 = 0.25 × 400 = 100
```

**Do:**
```
25% = 1/4
400/4 = 100
```

**Faster and fewer errors!**

---

#### **Strategy 2: Check Reasonableness**

**Quick checks:**
- 50% of anything is half
- 100% of something is itself
- More than 100% means greater than original

---

#### **Strategy 3: Write Formula First**

```
Formula: % = (Part/Whole) × 100
Substitute: = (30/150) × 100
Calculate: = 20%
```

**Organized approach reduces errors**

---

#### **Strategy 4: Use Mental Benchmarks**

**Example:** Is 47% of 200 closer to 90 or 100?
```
50% of 200 = 100
47% is slightly less
So closer to 90-95
```

---

#### **Strategy 5: Double-Check Base**

**When comparing percentages:**
- "More than" → smaller base
- "Less than" → larger base
- Write it clearly!

---

### **TIPS FOR SPEED AND ACCURACY**

#### **Speed Tips:**

**1. Memorize Fraction Equivalents**
```
1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/8, 1/10
Instant conversion!
```

**2. Use 10% as Building Block**
```
10% of 350 = 35
20% = 70
30% = 105
5% = 17.5
```

**3. Recognize Patterns**
- Successive changes → Formula
- Restoration → Memorized values
- Elections → Margin formula

**4. Simplify Fractions First**
```
(40/160) × 100 = (1/4) × 100 = 25%
```

**5. Skip Unnecessary Steps**
- If asking for %, don't find actual value
- Use ratios directly

**6. Mental Math for Common Values**
```
25% = Quarter
33.33% = Third
50% = Half
75% = Three-fourths
```

**7. Use Multipliers for Successive Changes**
```
+20% then -10%: 1.2 × 0.9 = 1.08
```

---

#### **Accuracy Tips:**

**1. Identify What's Being Asked**
- Percentage itself?
- Actual value?
- Percentage change?

**2. Check Your Base**
- % more than → smaller base
- % less than → larger base

**3. Verify Formula**
```
Write: % Increase = (New-Old)/Old × 100
Then substitute
```

**4. Use Benchmarks**
- 50% is half
- 100% is same as original
- 200% is double

**5. Check Sign**
- Increase → positive
- Decrease → negative

**6. Verify Units**
- If asked "%", answer should be number only
- If asked value, include units

**7. Cross-Check with Simple Case**
- Does formula work for 100%?
- Does it work for 50%?
