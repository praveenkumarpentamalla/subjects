# SIMPLE AND COMPOUND INTEREST: Complete Mastery Guide for Government Exams

## 1. FOUNDATION TO ADVANCED COVERAGE

### **BASIC CONCEPTS (Foundation Level)**

#### **A. What is Interest?**

**Definition:** Interest is the **cost of borrowing money** or the **reward for lending money**.

**Real-world Examples:**
- **Loan:** You borrow ₹10,000 from bank, pay back ₹11,000 → Interest = ₹1,000
- **Savings:** You deposit ₹10,000, bank gives ₹10,500 after 1 year → Interest = ₹500
- **Credit Card:** You spend ₹5,000, pay ₹5,100 next month → Interest = ₹100

---

#### **B. Key Terms (Must Know)**

**1. Principal (P):**
- Original amount borrowed or invested
- Starting amount
- Example: Loan of ₹50,000 → P = ₹50,000

**2. Rate of Interest (R):**
- Percentage charged per time period (usually per year)
- Example: 10% per annum → R = 10%

**3. Time (T):**
- Duration for which money is borrowed/invested
- Usually in years
- Example: 3 years → T = 3

**4. Interest (I):**
- Amount charged for borrowing/using money
- Extra money paid/received

**5. Amount (A):**
- Total money paid/received at the end
- Amount = Principal + Interest
- A = P + I

---

### **SIMPLE INTEREST (SI)**

#### **A. Basic Concept**

**Definition:** Interest calculated ONLY on the principal amount throughout the entire period.

**Formula:**
```
SI = (P × R × T) / 100
```

**Memory: "PRT by 100"**

---

#### **B. Understanding SI with Example**

**Example:** Principal = ₹1,000, Rate = 10% p.a., Time = 3 years

**Year-by-year:**
```
Year 1: Interest = 10% of 1000 = ₹100
Year 2: Interest = 10% of 1000 = ₹100 (still on original principal!)
Year 3: Interest = 10% of 1000 = ₹100
Total SI = ₹300
```

**Key Point:** Each year's interest is calculated on the ORIGINAL principal!

---

#### **C. Amount Formula for SI**

```
Amount = Principal + Simple Interest
A = P + SI
A = P + (PRT/100)
A = P(1 + RT/100)
```

**Example:** P = ₹10,000, R = 5%, T = 2 years
```
SI = (10000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = ₹1,000
Amount = 10,000 + 1,000 = ₹11,000
```

---

#### **D. Variations of SI Formula**

**Finding Principal:**
```
P = (SI × 100) / (R × T)
P = (A × 100) / (100 + RT)
```

**Finding Rate:**
```
R = (SI × 100) / (P × T)
```

**Finding Time:**
```
T = (SI × 100) / (P × R)
```

---

### **COMPOUND INTEREST (CI)**

#### **A. Basic Concept**

**Definition:** Interest calculated on the principal PLUS previously earned interest.

**Key Difference from SI:** Interest earns interest!

---

#### **B. Understanding CI with Example**

**Example:** Principal = ₹1,000, Rate = 10% p.a., Time = 3 years

**Year-by-year:**
```
Year 1: 
Amount = 1000 + 10% of 1000 = 1000 + 100 = ₹1,100
Interest = ₹100

Year 2:
Amount = 1100 + 10% of 1100 = 1100 + 110 = ₹1,210
Interest = ₹110 (on increased principal!)

Year 3:
Amount = 1210 + 10% of 1210 = 1210 + 121 = ₹1,331
Interest = ₹121

Total CI = 100 + 110 + 121 = ₹331
```

**Notice:** CI (₹331) > SI (₹300) for same P, R, T!

---

#### **C. CI Formula (Annual Compounding)**

```
Amount = P(1 + R/100)^T

Where:
P = Principal
R = Rate per annum
T = Time in years
```

**Compound Interest:**
```
CI = Amount - Principal
CI = P(1 + R/100)^T - P
CI = P[(1 + R/100)^T - 1]
```

---

#### **D. Different Compounding Frequencies**

**1. Annually (Once a year):**
```
A = P(1 + R/100)^T
```

**2. Half-Yearly (Twice a year):**
```
A = P(1 + R/200)^(2T)

R → R/2 (divide rate by 2)
T → 2T (multiply time by 2)
```

**3. Quarterly (4 times a year):**
```
A = P(1 + R/400)^(4T)

R → R/4
T → 4T
```

**4. Monthly (12 times a year):**
```
A = P(1 + R/1200)^(12T)

R → R/12
T → 12T
```

**Pattern:** 
- Divide rate by frequency
- Multiply time by frequency

---

#### **E. Special Cases in CI**

**1. Different Rates for Different Years:**

```
A = P(1 + R₁/100)(1 + R₂/100)(1 + R₃/100)...

Example: P = 10,000, Year 1: 10%, Year 2: 15%
A = 10000(1.1)(1.15) = 10000 × 1.265 = ₹12,650
```

---

**2. When Rate Increases/Decreases:**

**Population/Growth Problems:**
```
Final Value = Initial × (1 + R/100)^T  (increase)
Final Value = Initial × (1 - R/100)^T  (decrease)
```

**Example:** Population 10,000, increases 5% annually for 2 years
```
Final = 10000(1.05)² = 10000 × 1.1025 = 11,025
```

---

### **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TECHNIQUES**

#### **A. Finding Time When Amount Doubles/Triples**

**For Simple Interest:**

**When amount doubles:**
```
Time = 100/R years
```

**Example:** At 5% SI, when does amount double?
```
T = 100/5 = 20 years
```

**When amount triples:**
```
Time = 200/R years
```

---

**For Compound Interest:**

**When amount doubles:**
```
(1 + R/100)^T = 2
```

**Common approximation (Rule of 72):**
```
Time ≈ 72/R years
```

**Example:** At 8% CI, doubling time?
```
T ≈ 72/8 = 9 years
```

---

#### **B. Difference Between CI and SI**

**For 2 Years:**
```
CI - SI = P(R/100)²
```

**For 3 Years:**
```
CI - SI = P(R/100)²(3 + R/100)
```

**Example:** P = 10,000, R = 10%, T = 2 years
```
SI = 10000 × 0.1 × 2 = ₹2,000
CI - SI = 10000 × (0.1)² = 10000 × 0.01 = ₹100
CI = 2000 + 100 = ₹2,100
```

**Quick formula saves time!**

---

#### **C. Installment Problems**

**Equal installments to pay off debt:**

**Formula:**
```
Each Installment = P × [(1 + R/100)^n × R] / [(1 + R/100)^n - 1]
```

**For exams:** Usually given as simple problems - calculate year by year.

---

### **ADVANCED PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES**

#### **A. Effective Rate for CI**

**When compounded more frequently:**

**Effective Annual Rate:**
```
Effective R = [(1 + r/n)^n - 1] × 100

where:
r = nominal rate
n = compounding frequency
```

**Example:** 12% compounded quarterly
```
Effective R = [(1 + 0.12/4)^4 - 1] × 100
            = [(1.03)^4 - 1] × 100
            = [1.1255 - 1] × 100
            = 12.55%
```

---

#### **B. Present Value and Future Value**

**Present Value (PV):**
- Amount needed today to get a certain amount in future

**Formula:**
```
PV = FV / (1 + R/100)^T
```

**Example:** What to invest today at 10% CI to get ₹12,100 after 2 years?
```
PV = 12100 / (1.1)²
   = 12100 / 1.21
   = ₹10,000
```

---

#### **C. Continuous Compounding**

**Rarely in government exams, but good to know:**

```
A = Pe^(rt)

where e ≈ 2.718
```

---

```
T = 200/R years
```

---

#### **B. Compound Interest**

```

**9. CI:**
```
CI = P[(1 + R/100)^T - 1]
```

**10. Half-Yearly:**
```
A = P(1 + R/200)^(2T)
```

```

**15. Different Rates:**
```
A = P(1 + R₁/100)(1 + R₂/100)(1 + R₃/100)...
```

**16. Growth/Decay:**
```
Increase: A = P(1 + R/100)^T
Decrease: A = P(1 - R/100)^T
```

---

### **TIME-SAVING SHORTCUTS**

#### **Shortcut 1: Quick SI Calculation**

**For mental math:**
```
SI = P × R × T / 100
```

**Break it down:**
```
1% of P for T years = (P/100) × T
R% = R times that
```

**Example:** P = 5000, R = 6%, T = 3 years
```
1% of 5000 = 50
50 × 3 years = 150 per year
6% → 150 × 6 = ₹900
```

---

#### **Shortcut 2: Doubling/Tripling (SI)**

**Instant formulas:**
```
Double: T = 100/R
Triple: T = 200/R
n times: T = 100(n-1)/R
```

**Example:** At 5% SI, to make amount 4 times?
```
T = 100(4-1)/5 = 300/5 = 60 years
```

---

#### **Shortcut 3: Rule of 72 (CI Doubling)**

**Quick approximation:**
```
Doubling Time ≈ 72/R
```

**Example:** 12% CI
```
T ≈ 72/12 = 6 years
```

**Also works for:**
- Rule of 69: More accurate (69/R)
- Rule of 70: Easy calculation (70/R)

---

#### **Shortcut 4: CI for 2 Years (Quick Method)**

**Instead of calculating year by year:**
```
A = P(1 + R/100)²
  = P[1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)²]
  = P[1 + 2R/100 + R²/10000]
```

**Example:** P = 10,000, R = 10%, T = 2 years
```
A = 10000[1 + 0.2 + 0.01]
  = 10000 × 1.21 = ₹12,100
```

---

#### **Shortcut 5: CI - SI Difference (2 years)**

**Direct formula:**
```
Difference = P × (R/100)²
```

**Example:** P = 8000, R = 5%
```
Diff = 8000 × (0.05)²
     = 8000 × 0.0025
     = ₹20
```

**No need to calculate CI and SI separately!**

---

#### **Shortcut 6: Percentage Increase Pattern**

**For successive increases:**
```
10% increase then 20% increase ≠ 30% increase!

Actual = (1.1 × 1.2 - 1) × 100 = 32%
```

**General:**
```
Net% = a + b + (ab/100)
```

---

#### **Shortcut 7: Half-Yearly Quick Check**

**When R and T are such that division is easy:**

**Example:** 10% half-yearly for 1 year
```
= 5% twice
= (1.05)² = 1.1025
= 10.25% effective rate
```

---

#### **Shortcut 8: Power of Common Values**

**Memorize:**
```
(1.05)² = 1.1025
(1.1)² = 1.21
(1.1)³ = 1.331
(1.2)² = 1.44
(1.25)² = 1.5625
(0.9)² = 0.81
(0.95)² = 0.9025
```

**Saves calculation time!**

---

#### **Shortcut 9: Finding Principal from Amount (CI)**

**When you know A, R, T:**
```
P = A / (1 + R/100)^T
```

**Example:** A = 12,100, R = 10%, T = 2 years
```
P = 12100 / 1.21 = ₹10,000
```

---

#### **Shortcut 10: Same SI for Different P, R, T**

**If SI is same:**
```
P₁R₁T₁ = P₂R₂T₂
```

**Example:** If ₹1000 at 10% for 2 years gives same SI as ₹2000 at R% for 1 year:
```
1000 × 10 × 2 = 2000 × R × 1
20000 = 2000R
R = 10%
```

---

Key insight: Amount after 6 years is (Amount after 3 years) × (same factor)

Let initial sum = P
After 3 years: P(1+R/100)³ = 13380
After 6 years: P(1+R/100)⁶ = 20070

Dividing:
(1+R/100)³ = 20070/13380 = 1.5

Therefore:
P × 1.5 = 13380
P = 13380/1.5 = ₹8,920
```

**Answer:** ₹8,920
**Time:** 40 seconds

---

**Q10. [SSC CGL 2018]**
A certain sum amounts to ₹7,200 in 2 years and ₹7,680 in 3 years at simple interest. Find the principal and rate.

**Solution:**
```
SI for 1 year = 7680 - 7200 = ₹480

SI for 2 years = 480 × 2 = ₹960
Principal = 7200 - 960 = ₹6,240

Rate = (SI × 100) / (P × T)
     = (480 × 100) / (6240 × 1)
     = 48000 / 6240

**Q11. [Railway Group D 2019]**
The difference between CI and SI on a sum at 5% per annum for 3 years is ₹122. Find the sum.

**Solution (Formula for 3 years):**
```
CI - SI = P(R/100)²(3 + R/100)
122 = P(0.05)²(3 + 0.05)
122 = P × 0.0025 × 3.05
122 = P × 0.007625
P = 122 / 0.007625
P = ₹16,000
```

**Answer:** ₹16,000
**Time:** 40 seconds

**Q12. [SBI PO 2018]**
A sum becomes 3 times itself in 20 years at simple interest. In how many years will it become double?

**Solution:**
```
If sum triples: Amount = 3P
SI = 3P - P = 2P

2P = (P × R × 20) / 100
200 = 20R
R = 10%

For doubling:
T = 100/R = 100/10 = 10 years
```

**Q13. [SSC CGL 2021]**
A person invests ₹10,000 partly at 10% SI and partly at 12% SI. If total interest after 1 year is ₹1,080, how much was invested at each rate?

**Solution:**
```
Let x be invested at 10%, then (10000-x) at 12%

Interest equation:
(x × 10 × 1)/100 + ((10000-x) × 12 × 1)/100 = 1080
0.1x + 1200 - 0.12x = 1080
-0.02x = -120
x = 6000

At 10%: ₹6,000
At 12%: ₹4,000
```

**Answer:** ₹6,000 at 10%, ₹4,000 at 12%
**Time:** 50 seconds

**Q17. [SBI PO 2021]**
A sum doubles in 5 years at SI. At the same rate, in how many years will it become 8 times?

**Solution:**
```
Doubling time = 5 years
So T = 100/R gives: 5 = 100/R
R = 20%

For 8 times: Amount = 8P
SI = 8P - P = 7P

T = (7P × 100) / (P × 20)
  = 700 / 20
  = 35 years
```

**Shortcut:**
```
n times = (n-1) × doubling time
8 times = (8-1) × 5 = 35 years
```

**Answer:** 35 years
**Time:** 30 seconds

A sum of ₹8,000 is lent partly at 5% and partly at 8% SI. If total interest after 4 years is ₹2,000, how much was lent at each rate?

**Solution:**
```
Let x at 5%, (8000-x) at 8%

(x × 5 × 4)/100 + ((8000-x) × 8 × 4)/100 = 2000
0.2x + 2560 - 0.32x = 2000
-0.12x = -560
x = 560/0.12 = ₹4,666.67

At 5%: ₹4,667 (approx)
At 8%: ₹3,333 (approx)
```

**Answer:** ₹4,667 at 5%, ₹3,333 at 8%
**Time:** 55 seconds

Interest in 3rd year = 2662 - 2420 = ₹242

This is CI on ₹2,420:
R = (242 × 100) / 2420 = 10%

Principal:
P(1.1)² = 2420
P × 1.21 = 2420
P = 2420/1.21 = ₹2,000
```

**Answer:** P = ₹2,000, R = 10%
**Time:** 35 seconds

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES & TRAPS

### **FREQUENT ERRORS STUDENTS MAKE**

#### **Error 1: Confusing SI and CI**

❌ **Wrong:** Using SI formula for CI problem

**Example:** "Amount after 2 years at 10% CI"
- Wrong: Using SI = PRT/100

✅ **Correct:** Use A = P(1+R/100)²

**Tip:** Keywords like "compounded," "population," "depreciation" → CI

---

#### **Error 2: Not Converting Time for Half-Yearly/Quarterly**

❌ **Wrong:** Using T = 2 years directly for half-yearly

**Example:** 2 years half-yearly
- Wrong: T = 2

✅ **Correct:** T = 2 × 2 = 4 half-years

**Also adjust R:**
- R = Annual/2 for half-yearly
- R = Annual/4 for quarterly

---

#### **Error 3: Forgetting to Find Interest (Finding Amount Only)**

❌ **Wrong:** Stopping at Amount when Interest is asked

**Example:** "Find CI on ₹10,000..."
- Wrong: Calculating A = 11,000 and stopping

✅ **Correct:** CI = A - P = 11,000 - 10,000 = ₹1,000

---

#### **Error 4: Wrong Calculation in CI - SI Formula**

❌ **Wrong:** CI - SI = P × R² (missing /100²)

✅ **Correct:** CI - SI = P(R/100)²

**Example:** P = 10000, R = 10%
- Wrong: 10000 × 100 = 1,000,000
- Correct: 10000 × 0.01 = ₹100

---

#### **Error 5: Using Doubling Formula Wrong**

❌ **Wrong:** Using T = 72/R for SI

✅ **Correct:**
- SI: T = 100/R
- CI: T ≈ 72/R (Rule of 72)

---

#### **Error 6: Negative Signs in Growth/Decline**

❌ **Wrong:** Population decrease 10% → (1 + 10/100)

✅ **Correct:** (1 - 10/100) = 0.9

**Use minus for decrease/depreciation!**

---

#### **Error 7: Not Simplifying Before Calculating**

❌ **Wrong:** (5000 × 6 × 3)/100 = 90000/100 (long division)

✅ **Better:** Cancel zeros first
- = (50 × 6 × 3) = 900

---

### **TRICK QUESTIONS COMMONLY ASKED**

#### **Trick 1: The Half-Year Trap**

**Question:** "At 10% per annum CI for 1 year, compounded half-yearly"

**Trap:** Using (1.1)¹ = 10% annual

**Correct:**
```
R = 10/2 = 5% per half-year
T = 1 × 2 = 2 half-years
(1.05)² = 1.1025 = 10.25%
```

**More frequent compounding → Higher returns!**

---

#### **Trick 2: The "Becomes" vs "Interest is" Trap**

**Question:** "Amount **becomes** ₹1,200" vs "Interest **is** ₹1,200"

- **Becomes** → A = 1200
- **Interest is** → SI or CI = 1200, need to add P for Amount

---

#### **Trick 3: The Different Rates Trap**

**Question:** "10% for first year, 12% for second year"

**Trap:** Using average rate (11%)

**Correct:** Multiply separately
```
A = P(1.10)(1.12) = P × 1.232
```

---

#### **Trick 4: The Ratio Trap**

**Question:** "Ratio of SI to CI is 20:21"

**Trap:** Thinking they're very close

**Actual:** Can find R using this ratio
```
SI/CI = 20/21
For 2 years: SI = 2PR/100, CI = P(2R/100 + R²/10000)
Solve to find R
```

---

#### **Trick 5: The Time Period Language**

**Question:** "For 6 months" or "For 18 months"

**Trap:** Using T = 6 or T = 18

**Correct:** Convert to years
- 6 months = 0.5 years
- 18 months = 1.5 years

---

### **HOW TO AVOID CALCULATION MISTAKES**

#### **Strategy 1: Write What You Know**

```
Given: P = ?, R = ?, T = ?
Find: SI or CI or A?

Formula: ...
```

**Organizing prevents missing info!**

---

#### **Strategy 2: Check Units**

- Rate should be in %
- Time should be in years (unless adjusted)
- Amount should be > Principal

---

#### **Strategy 3: Verify Answer Makes Sense**

**Quick checks:**
- CI > SI (for same P, R, T > 1 year)
- Amount > Principal
- Higher rate → More interest

---

#### **Strategy 4: Use Approximation**

**Before exact calculation:**
```
SI on 5000 at 6% for 3 years:
≈ 5% for easy math = 250 per year
≈ 750 for 3 years
```

**Actual:** 900

**Close enough to catch major errors!**

---

#### **Strategy 5: Simplify Before Calculating**

**Example:** (8000 × 5 × 2) / 100
```
Cancel zeros: (80 × 5 × 2) = 800
```

**Faster and fewer errors!**

**5. Use Rule of 72**
- Quick doubling time for CI
- Easier than exact calculation

**6. Mental Math for Simple Cases**
```
10% of 1000 = 100
5% = half of 10% = 50
Easy to build up
```

**7. Skip Unnecessary Precision**
- If options are far apart
- Round to nearest convenient number

---

#### **Accuracy Tips:**

**1. Identify SI vs CI First**
- Read problem carefully
- Note keywords

**2. Write Formula Before Substituting**
```
Formula: SI = PRT/100
Substitute: SI = (5000 × 6 × 3)/100
Calculate: = 900
```

**3. Check: Is CI > SI?**
- For same P, R, T (T>1)
- CI should always be slightly more

**4. Verify Time Units**
- Convert months to years
- Adjust for half-yearly/quarterly

**5. Double-Check Rate Adjustments**
- Half-yearly: R/2 and 2T
- Quarterly: R/4 and 4T

**6. Use Amount Check**
```
Amount = Principal + Interest
Should always be true!
```
